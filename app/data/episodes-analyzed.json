    "description": "Guillermo Rauch, the CEO of Vercel, demonstrates how v0 has evolved from a simple prototyping tool to a complete development environment that supports the entire Git workflow. Guillermo shows how Vercel built skills.sh—a viral marketplace with over 34,000 community-submitted skills—using v0, and how the tool enables non-technical team members to contribute production-ready code changes. He walks through creating branches, implementing features, previewing changes, and submitting pull requests, all within v0.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. How v0’s new Git workflow integration enables anyone to contribute production-ready code changes\n2. Why skills.sh became a viral hub for AI skills, with 500 new submissions per hour\n3. How to implement features in v0 that consider production concerns like abuse prevention and rate limiting\n4. The benefits of branch previews for testing changes in a production-like environment before merging\n5. How v0 eliminates development environment setup challenges for non-technical team members\n6. Why the “terminal core” design aesthetic became central to skills.sh’s interface\n7. How Vercel uses v0 internally to democratize code contributions across teams\n8.

    "transcript": "I'll say one thing about VIP coding. It's really easy to go from zero to one. I think we've all seen the demos of I prom thing and it's cool. I think what's harder is to iterate on a project at scale and to deploy changes safely. Every marketer ever sells to change this page at some point and the old way was one of two ways. One is what I called you had to petition to the government. You had to go to engineers and say, \"Engineers, can you please add a logo over here or whatnot or pray that the CMS was perfectly wired up for any ambition or dream or idea you had. So now they can just open this page in VZ and prompt anything that they want. >> It reduces the friction of getting something live really, really low. the humiliation ritual of prioritization goes away and you can actually focus your time on defending the merits of an idea on the actual idea as opposed to the hypothesis of the idea that then has to be implemented. And so I think it changes the speed of companies in a really significant way. So this is truly a first time vibe podcast that we're doing together and I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Claire Vo. of a product leader and obsessed with AI and I have a podcast, How I AI, where I teach people how to build better with all these new tools, including ones that we're going to see today. And I'm really excited to have you here, G. First, we're just going to get to the the thing that everybody's wondering about. What is your most favorite feature that you released this week on VZero? >> Well, I'll tell you the hottest thing in AI today is skills. Everyone is excited about the fact that we can now augment agents and AI applications and agentic engineering with skills like skills that the model doesn't yet have. And so we launched skills.sh and the beautiful thing about what we'll show you today is that Vzero can seriously go from prototype all the way to production. So we're able to conceive changes to things like skills.sh. I'm going to show you really quickly. Skills.sh SH is a new you can think of it as like npm. It's a hub an open ecosystem of skills and it's pretty dramatic what's happening to this site. So you can see that we now have 34,000 skills submitted by the community and this website has gone viral all over the internet. It's hosted on Verscell but the most exciting part to me is that it was conceived in Bzero. >> I have a quick question for the audience. How many of you have installed a skill in the last week? >> Oh wow. >> Okay. A lot of people >> skill build. >> Um, how many of you have the top three installed? >> Actually, top >> it's very heavy at the top. Right. It's like >> these are ripping. >> Oh, no. I have top seven. Okay. Yeah, I have the top seven installed right now. Um, this is a really great resource. So, for folks that are maybe watching this later or haven't been familiar with skills, skills is now this standard that a lot of these agentic frameworks are using. to help you repurpose and reuse best practices, step-by-step flows. And so, for example, I use this Remotion best practices one um to let me import components and regularly create videos really, really quickly. And I would not have been able to do this without the expertise that's been packaged in these best practices that were installed with one line um using skills.sh. I think it's also worth noting maybe to peel the covers of how Versel builds products. >> Yep. >> Skills out a stage was a thing that was just conceived at the moment of inspiration. We started prompting, hey, wouldn't it be cool >> if this thing took shape? >> Would we discussed for example what it should look like? We we've been calling this style terminal core because it looks a little bit like this is my contribution to the project. I was like, hey, wouldn't it be cool if we make the top of the website look like a terminal? And so the the the process itself of building this was very much prompt driven I'll say like chatting in Slack and saying hey wouldn't it be nice if we had a hub for this just very iterative very collaborative between the team members at Verscell and what's really cool about this again is it's really fast so it takes advantage of all the versel infrastructure primitives even though it has 35,000 of the skills like if I start like like hardcore scrolling this and then pick a random one. All right, Swift Taylor Swift. You're going to see like the page transitions are are swift to UI. Okay, but uh like all the page transitions are instant production grade. He needed to scale. There were going to be a lot of eyes on this thing. >> Okay. So, I think we want to get to our first workflow for how AI and you just want to show us how you either develop this or how you and the team improve this over time using the tool. >> I'll say one thing about VIP coding. It's really easy to go from zero to one. Like I think we've all seen the demos of I prom thing and it's cool and I think what's harder is to iterate on a project at scale and to deploy changes safely. In in the case of how we work on versel products, we always work on branches and we take advantage of branch previews and then we code review and then we merge them. So what we're basically going to be showing you today is how we brought those ideas of hardcore heavyduty production grade engineering to visit. So I'm here I'm binding that same project that you just saw skills.sh which is piped into is basically backed by git the engineer who built this pushed some code three hours ago and you have this new button within v 0ero which is a new branch. So what this is showing you is that B 0 is making the git flow of creating branches a first class citizen of the product. So I'm going to create a branch and basically this is going to give me the same sort of like chat experience you're used to. But notice here at the top I get this beautiful new convention of project slash branch. Right? So I have the v 0/rouchg branch. And here within the preview, you're going to notice that just like if you had cloned the project to your local device, we both have a full full scale uh VS Code editor as well as the real project running within VZ. One thing I want to pause and notice because I just have a laser eye for product is I love that you use the convention that all of us with engineering teams use on our git branches which is who's the contributor slash what's the feature and so what I think this is really interesting you know we're going to talk about how you actually use these tools to build but I also think there's a flip side of how you design great um AI products and agentic products and I still like the small design tweaks that make something like a vzero feel like a collaborative teammate on your So I for all the engineers out there, I noticed I noticed that little convention. >> So I and what you're going to see in the design philosophy of the product is that we really wanted to embed those little details of what makes a real engineering workflow come to life, but in a really easy way, right? Like at the end of the day, I didn't have to go to a terminal or boot up GitHub desktop and branch manually. Like it's the stone age. I just press a button and now I have a branch running. So the main idea here is that within this preview I have the full skills.sh project running. It downloaded dependencies. It installed the exact versions of Nex.js and every dependency uh within the project. I have it all running here. I have it obviously within a staging or dev sort of environment. And now you know I I could navigate it like uh I could navigate the production website. I could explore it. I could, you know, use all the capabilities that Vzero uh brings to the table, but I figured let's actually build a feature that we could ship to prod. >> Yeah. And one thing I want to pause on what you I think glossed over a little bit, which is the fact that you have this VS Code instance, the fact that you have all your dependencies installed, the fact that this is running both with code and a preview. For anybody who's less technical out there, and maybe a lot of your users that are using vzero.app app are less technical. This even like downloading VS Code, getting your local environment set up, like I spent this morning with my designer installing homebrew like like it just wasn't on her laptop. And so >> it's nightmare feel. >> It's nightmare. And so if you're trying to step from this like vibe coding prototype in web experience into feeling more like a software engineer without having to have Claire handhold you through like brew install, this gets you like halfway there. And so I think there's also this learning aspect of it I want to make sure people don't miss. But let's get into building something obvious. >> So one another part of our product development process is really listening to community and listening to customers. So people have been asking for a lot of different tools so that we could guide them towards knowing if a skill is high quality, vetted, verified because there's so many skills. At last we checked there were 500 skills being added every hour. And so one of the ideas that we came up with is like could we add um a rating system. So let's add a fivestarbased rating system for the skills. Uh put it on the sidebar. Um be mindful. So I'll also give you like a little bit of my real time consciousness on if I were talking to an engineer and say like what could go wrong if we accept ratings from the internet. One of the things that can go wrong if you accept ratings from is abuse. So let's say let's tell VZ be mindful that uh we should rate limit or prevent abuse on the scores that we receive. And again, for me, it's all about thinking from a production readiness point of view when I think about the new VZO and make it make sense within the style of this skills website. >> What I love about what you're showing us is you have this very very high sophistication prompt here, which is make it make sense. So, we have three three incomplete sentences on a production app serving thousands, millions of people. and you're going to fire it off. And while you do this, one of the things I want to just call out that I think you know why this feature is maybe important right now is I don't know if you've heard there's like this crustation crawling all over everybody's MacBook minis and skills can be a a prompt injected vector for things. And so as you're trying to make sure that this becomes the centralized hub for discovering skills, which I think it's starting to be, it is upon you to kind of make sure that the quality is there, at least you have the right thing um right things in place so people can make the decision to follow with your analogy. This is a little bit like we're vibe coding on top github.com or npmjs.com. It's like a really really big deal. >> All right. So I was going to walk you through what Vzero is doing which of course if you've used V 0ero before we everyone does the whole like talk over the thinking trace because agents are not the fastest but I do want to point out a few things that are really important. So um D0 is all about leveraging the integration and marketplace capabilities of RCEL. So in this case it knows what the data source is of this project right we're storing data in reddis by app stash obviously it's going to go through the whole file system it's going to try to interpret my requirements this is already like really nice to see that it's not inventing a new way to store the data like it's actually paying attention to the data that I use um and so we'll take a look at uh again here like it actually gave me something that meets my requirements right? Like it fits within the design style. I can submit a rating. It is stores the rating. So I have now my fivestar one rating. I guess I'm going to >> It's terminal core monace font. >> Um let's refresh the page to see that persistence actually works. Beautiful. There's a tiny bit of layout shift that triggers my neurosis. So we'll tell it, hey, when we don't have data, make sure there's no layout shift. By the way, for those of you that are like less neurotic, I guess. So, it bothered me that when we refreshed the page, when we didn't have data, like it jittered the sidebar a little bit. So, we're just going to have the zero. >> So, while we're uh jibber jabbering while the it's thinking, which I have to get very good at as a podcast. So, I will call out that I have observed a Verscell internal hackathon and I have seen this man screenshot like rounded corners that are not right and just put them in the chat with like a question mark. And so it's it's yeah it it speaks to my um >> my very attention to detail heart that you saw you saw that did it work. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm fairly satisfied like the Yeah. >> The skeleton was stable. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Uh zero layout shift. So let's continue with the we we talked about this uh hardcore uh engineering workflow like if if we were making a change like this on skills age again receiving hundreds of skills per hour with lots of visitors we first want to make sure that things work right and right now you you can think of this as a very capable dev environment we're booting up the NexJS dev server in a virtual machine it's it's it's basically very true to the actual end result. In fact, thank you to the Nex.js engineers who sweated all of the details of mirroring to the best of their ability the dev environment and the production environment. But there is another layer of assurance that we can get, right, which is so if you're more familiar with the g like the GitHub world, the GitHub side of things, you know that when you push a new PR to GitHub, the this beautiful Versel bot comes to sort of save the day, right? you know that it builds what you what you're changing and then it previews it. Not only that, but notice that Vzero really cooks. Vzero is making me look so good here because I haven't written a PR description in like 25 years 84 years. So Vzero produced a PR described it um and then the magic of our cell is coming in right so it's giving me that uh preview. So I'm going to I'm going to open it here. I'm going to say visit preview. I I'm just again I'm going to be a software engineer for a second. Can we appreciate how quickly that preview branch deployed? >> Well, don't trigger me because it can be 10 times quicker. But yeah, I'm proud of it. >> Explain. >> Now I have a production-like environment. So when you see this URL ending onverell.sh is our enterprise versell environment. That's why it had the 17 steps of logging in. Um but this is basically running on the production grade CDN on the production grade rendering infrastructure hosting infrastructure etc. So now when I'm seeing that you know rating there I have pretty pretty good confidence. I was like yeah this is shippable. >> Okay so I have to ask a couple questions about the you know inside the house view of this. Is this how you all are shipping code or is this a big chunk of how you're shipping code to this? Is it 100%? How are you actually using this for production? >> So it's really interesting. We when we cook on a on a project or a product internally, we hold ourselves to the same sort of high bar as if you had launched a product externally because you want to make sure that people are actually adopting it, right? And so before before we started chatting and I'm going to give you a glimpse of again the behind the scenes of Verscell, uh we've talked a lot publicly about our data analyst agent D0. Yes, we're very creative with with names. We take the first initial and we add a zero. So this is our data uh AI powered assistant and I was actually asking it um I said um Vzero this is me by the way uh tell me about PR's merged with Vzero in the recent weeks tell me about its growth so again PR's merged with DZ is a totally novel thing and DZ cooked thank you DZ it said PRs merged via DZ have seen explosive growth in the last week wow explo explosive growth. >> I have to appreciate whoever prompt managed this one because it did not put the explosion of OG in there, which I think would also trigger G. >> All right, we should uh Yeah. Uh trigger warning. Starting from near zero in early January, the feature hit 3200 PR submerged per day by January 2829, which is basically today. An extraordinary 100x. The bots, the AIS do like to like like Yeah. like sweet sweet tacas. But um it's it's pretty amazing. So this is in very very very early uh preview, right? Like we we're just letting people in. But I mean this is just such a beautiful workflow. I mean imagine triggering a task like this from your phone, from Slack, from vzero.app. Another convenience that we're adding is that you can take a a U GitHub repo like this and I can go to the homepage and then I can paste it. And so now I could import something that I already have and create a chat from it. So anytime I have an idea for a realworld project and product that has in production, I can now prompt. So I estimate that this is going to change fundamentally how we work, right? Uh it's also very visual in nature which is really cool. Obviously, there's a lot of ways of like getting preview getting uh changes made by agents today out out there in the world. These everyone's very excited about what what AI can do, but this is actually showing me the the actual results and like things that are going to happen. So, I I grade this really high for the kind of products that we build at VCell and uh I expect this to continue to have a lot of traction. >> So, I have to ask you sort of operationally, how do you imagine companies do this? And one of the things I'm thinking is I was chatting with Caroline who interrupted you all and say we're said we're going to start the podcast and she said last night I was prepping for this demo and I vzero coded something and somebody saw it and was like well that's a good idea you should just merge it and ship it like do you imagine or inside the company who's shipping code how are you enabling that as a CEO how does the culture support it how does it not >> until now everyone could cook right everyone could create a prototype a new design a suggestion. In fact, uh, moment of vulnerability because I haven't really even opened this in a while, but like, uh, let's see if I have I probably created a bunch of things that I've been suggesting to the teams that we could look at, right? Um, ignore this one for a second, but um, so anytime I have an idea on how to improve the product, I nowadays create a Vzero. Now the difference is that until I had this mechanism to hand it off as a pull request to the engineering team then I was kind of like playing in La La Lands. I was like in out there in this like prototype world and now we have a common foundation and a common substrate so that if you have an idea whether you work in marketing like marketers always want to change the website like imagine like go to verscell.com I'll show you a page that is actually quite uh fun at versell so our enterprise page every marketer of versell wants to change this page at some point right and the old way was to one of one of two ways. One is what I called you had to petition to the government. You had to go to engineers and say engineers please can you can you please add a logo over here or whatnot or pray that the CMS was perfectly wired up for any ambition or dream or idea you had. So now they can just open this page in VZ and prompt anything that they want. But it would be somewhat irresponsible to just ship it, right? So with the Git workflow and opening a PR and being able to preview it, we can all build confidence that it's going to be a good change, roll it back if needed, and and again, this is a website that's it's pretty pretty large. >> What I think is fun about this from an org perspect perspective is it reduces the friction of getting something live really really low, right? And like the humiliation ritual of prioritization goes away and you can actually focus your time on defending the merits of an idea on the actual idea as opposed to the hypothesis of the idea that then has to be implemented. And so I think it changes the speed of companies in in a really significant way. And you worked I mean to say the least at launch darkly >> and you know that a true production grade release process involves things like feature flags and experiments and things need to be measured and there's events that are critical to report from these product surfaces. And so this is also where I see the um skills that we can add to vzero and that you can contribute yourself to play a very important role because sometimes you know like we're all operating on this like websites and pixels and whatnot and we say like ah it's seems easy how risky could it be to move this button 20 pixels to the right and so I think we can make vibe coding scale to that kind of rigor that exists within enterprises and companies at scale >> well and if we're being honest on that enterprise it's not going to be moving a button two pixels. It's going to be switching the emphasis. I know this cuz I spent my life in enterprise. Switching the emphasis between contact sales and view the product. There's going to be a perpetual debate which one's the primary call to action and which is the secondary. >> Okay. I we so we've shown uh new v0ero import GitHub which I think is really great. Do a pull request. Copy and paste your GitHub URL in to import it. Actually push to production. Make friends with your engineers. three sentence prompting, no more than that. I want to go to quick because we want to keep this tight. I want to go to a quick lightning round with you and ask you a couple different AI questions. So, what is your favorite non I mean everything's a coding use case, I'm sure, with you, but what is your favorite non-coding use case of AI? >> Well, I'm conflicted. My mind immediately went to image generation because I used uh so we built a banger playground. Uh I don't want to share screen again. I want to take it from you. But >> this is Oh, no. I was just going to say image generation is how I got this pretty pretty background. >> Um bzero nano banana >> pro. Nano banana. >> So what's really cool that's happening at Verscell today is that we're building so many of our own internal tools and agents and so we're building our own design tools like for example to create new images. We created a playground for Nan Banana and I use that a lot. So I use it to make memes uh guilty is charged. Uh, but I also use it when I want to present information in really cool ways. When I tweet, when I sometimes I have to make u present my vision in a way that's more like on the image side of things. I combine it a lot with vzero because nanobana is really good at like again letting me fire off 20 generations in parallel and then pick the one that I actually like and then I toss it into v 0ero and then I actually get more fidelity of what I want to implement. So image generation is is a big one, but also I'm very excited about video generation. We're going to be dropping something. I don't want to spoil it too much. Uh we're going to be dropping something uh on the video side as well. Um and but yeah, all all AI is uh I also I also kick off a lot of research tasks like long horizon research tasks. Uh yeah. So, one of the things I want to call out from a Nano Banana perspective on our podcast is I've used Nano Banana to turn every conversation, I think we're now at 118 workflows, every AI workflow that we talk about on the podcast gets its own pretty consistent nano banana infographic. And so, I just think there's just such undervalued use cases in both idio uh image and videogen. And I'm about to take this and turn them all into little mini videos. >> We also created a really awesome I don't know if we've written about it yet. that we're publishing on the blog post. We have an uh OG image like open graph card, Twitter card generator that we use internally that combines uh more traditional rendering techniques but also image generation. So a bottleneck in our team was sometimes literally like can we get that social card to get the announcement through the door. >> And so now we we've also sort of automated and identify that. Every day we're basically asking ourselves how can we build an agent that takes over a task that we were previously giving to a person and uh and typically the person that was working on that task is now the one creating the agent. Yeah. So something we said at the beginning is we want B zero to be really awesome for you all to create agents not just traditional web applications. So that's that's basically the the the road map of the product. >> So I have to say uh my favorite so that's your favorite use case. My favorite use case of your use of VZero which I don't know if you're you're prepared for me to have this much knowledge about what you vibe code is your Asiato Asia chess game. >> My kids are obsessed with this. They think it's because they got the AI chess board and now they're like playing chess at various levels. >> By the way, I learned a lot. So, so it was really cool like during the holidays I uh I'm a I'm kind of a visual person. >> So, the chess AI thing has been done before, but I imagined this sort of um imagine like ESPN is is is is broadcasting a a final of a chess match and they're going over the shoulder of each player and showing the the the chessboard obviously in 3D. And so I I figured could could V 0 generate 3D code, right? Could it render with 3JS and things like that a uh a live chess match and could I have two AIs battle it out? And so um I mean you could open it. So the zero- chess-match.resellapp. Um and the other thing the other thing I wonder if I am SEOed or not. >> You you're number one. Good job. >> Oh, yes. >> Oh, a little terminal core over here. >> So, terminal core, of course. But, uh, so what I did is I I I started streaming the thinking tokens of the models. Uh, apologies to Google in advance. Uh, we're using a very old model of theirs that is really cheap, but they're losing two 225. At least they got five in. So, you can see the thinking tokens of the models. This is combining all of the Versel AI infrastructure. It's using a workflow so the game could run forever. The game could literally run forever or or until I run out of tokens. >> AI gateway. >> Uh AI gateway of course because we can change models like we could we could see like Brock versus you know uh whatever uh what dropped this week when threeax thinking. Uh but also I learned chess incidentally because not from these guys. These guys are kind of dumb. Uh, you can see how it thinks through what piece to move and it says, \"Oh, no, because if I move it there, I'm going to get F. So, I need to do this.\" So, this is a fun visor created during the holidays. >> Yeah. So, I need a kid core version of this. Um, I also want to see how much these models are spending to beat and lose. >> Well, beautiful thing about the AI gateway is that we kind of report, you know, for this prompt, how much did it cost you with this model, etc. Um, but see, so this is GPT open source which is actually pretty decent and uh pretty cheap. So >> great. And then so on this so that's my kids favorite your V0. >> I don't know if they have a favorite my V. >> It's popular with kids. I also got another parent reach out to me and say like oh this really inspired us and we're going to use Vzero together to create more things. >> My kids a a DAU on VZero. Don't worry about it. So this is my second question which is what is the last thing you built with your kids that was really fun. So the other day I brought them all to the office and what we started vibe coding is so now we want to do things that are more like physical AI like bring AI to the real world. I think it's the next frontier and so at the office we have a a thing called Vesta board which is a board where you can basically render things in the real world. >> And I think I really broke their their brains that day. Not all of them because I I brought four of them and one was on his iPad not paying attention. It was almost like bringing them to Sunday school for what it's worth. Uh but two of them were like, \"Holy crap, you can type in code and then you can change the real world.\" So I kind of taught them the concept of an API. Uh and yeah, all vibe coded and um I I took one of the nannies too and she was mind-blown. >> Well, that is teaching everyone how to v code. That is uh you and I we're like twin stars here because while you have the Vesta board which is pretty big, I have this like tiny like 32x32 pixel fake little mini computer that my kids and I are like vibe coding little screens on and little games on. So I completely agree. Take it off the screen for many reasons. If you have kids, put it in the real world and you can do some fun stuff and blow their mind. >> Sending a packet and responding to it. And the beautiful thing about Vzero and things like this is like you're literally speaking English to the computer. So I think if you can teach them that they can express their thoughts and desires, then they can make anything happen. >> Okay, important question. Are you teaching your kids to type? >> That's a tough one because I was when I grew up in Argentina, my dad got me this soccer game. He tricked me. I thought, \"Oh, he's getting me FIFA or something cool.\" No, he got me a soccer typing game. So to score, I had to type really fast. And that's how you learn to type really fast. But nowadays, like they're kind of getting really into the the speech to text thing. I need to find that hack where like, \"Oh, I got you Roblox.\" And it's not. It's just typing. >> It's just typing. So, I uh I I'm tricking my youngests right now. We have a Switch and I really want to play Ocarina of Time for people that were born when that game came out a million years ago. And the only reason I let him play it is it's like 99% just reading. >> And so I'm like, you can play this very slow paced game. It's a game. It's really just going NPC to NPC and reading to >> phrases. So we played a game like this with my kids during the holiday break. Um it was basically like a puzzle math game that looked like a game and that inspired. So okay, good and bad. The good was the game was like really educational. The bad was like it was like at ridden brain rot slop. And so it's like okay huge opportunity for someone to create a game platform. You can combine all of these models. You can do image generation for the assets. We're about to drop something insanely cool text to SVG. There's models that now produce really really high qual. We're going to uh share recraft models through the Verscell AI gateway. So you can create assets that are beautiful game ready scalable in high DPI screens whatever iPad. And so I really I I I I see the future of really high quality content uh at our fingertips uh and getting rid of all this slop. >> Yeah. Well, um I you know my my future roadmap releases are not as confidential as yours and so I am in the back of my mind working on like Mama Claire's dojo for Crack Little Hackers. >> Nice. >> So maybe someday and deployed on obviously Verscell. Okay, last question. Uh, do you when you're frustrated prompt AI the same way I have seen you prompt in Zoom chat which is explain how do you how do you how do you yeah question mark like what do you do when it's not giving you what you want? So I I do think that what we what we're dropping now is going to help you so much for the moments where I mean let's be real you can get stuck with AI right but now that you can essentially have this full like let's call it escape hatch right like you can if you want you can clone the repo and keep cooking on your local machine or if you need some someone else to help you this is fundamentally a collaborative medium that's the thing that GitHub unlocked for the world collaboration between engineers designers marketers and So um I I foresee that a lot less people are going to get stuck frankly. The models also keep getting smarter. Skills is going to help you a lot as well. So I'll give you an example. We are always adding new frameworks and new capabilities and XJS is getting more powerful and the AI SDK now that we have skills for those that we're going to preload into vo the model itself is not going to get it stuck as easily because now it has more resources to like figure out how to solve that problem. Another thing that I've done it actually used it for this project. So there's a lot of subtleties about this this 3D thing that I didn't know anything about 3D. So whenever I would get stuck, I would ask other models. Um I think it was something about um the way that and kudos to the um awesome soul the the the gentleman that uh open sourced the 3D. So I got it from Sketch Fab and he didn't design this for creating a game or anything like that. So all of the pieces were stuck together. It was almost like you had 3D printed it and the pieces were stuck together with the board. And so I obviously I want that sweet animation that when the model decides it moves the piece, right? Um and so I had to ask a lot of questions to other models about, hey, teach me what's going on with this 3D thing. How do I how do I reason about it? And then I would copy what another model tells me and I would toss it into Vzero. So, uh, another thing that you can do when you get stuck is you you she she can't see it here because it's only for me, but there's a debug button. And what the debug button says, I asked Bzero, \"Hey, give me debugging tools so that I can visualize the mesh of the 3D model. I can visualize, I can turn the textures on and off.\" And so the the AI itself can help itself and can give you tools to debug problems, which is kind of meta, but try it. Try it and it's going to work well for you. >> Okay. So, you you ask an expert, which is another model. I mean, find out the right question to ask. Well, this has been very fun. Thank you for showing us a little bit behind the curtain of how you use Vzero, all the new stuff, some of the ways you use it in your personal life and fun projects. We love to see it. So, you have this new VZ. You have this room full of people. What do you want from them? What What can they do for you? >> I mean, get busy shipping. So, try it out. Uh give us feedback. Uh we will fix it as very very fast because we're going to be dog eating our own dog food. Uh and yeah share the things that you built uh with Vzero. >> Oh we have a question back here. Oh I love it. >> So I had a question. Thank you for sharing like the feedback process how you loop um in terms of like from ideation to like production like during that process do you do any like product market fit? How do you validate that what you're trying to build is actually like useful or um impactful for like your ecosystem? Yeah, super hot off the presses new sort of mental model that we've been using internally. There's a customer zero and a customer one. Customer zero, we like to to be ourselves. We uh it's like the Rick Rubin, the confidence in our ability to know what's good, whatever. Like we like our taste. We we've been around the block for a while. We want we have ideas of products that we would like to see out there in the in the universe. Uh but customer one is also really important like a closed design partner Claire Vo. >> Oh >> Claire Vzero and our Claire and our our CPO are constantly texting. >> We're on a text chain. >> She she she texts bug reports. She texts things she needs. So having that group of design partners, enterprise companies, individuals, community members, people that slide into my XVMs. So it's you always wanted that pressure test of of the world. And for skills it was that you know people telling us hey like why does Opus 4.5 kind of know the latest XJS but not really and how can we embed your best practices. So that was kind of like in in our backlog like we were thinking about that problem for a while but then it also became really concrete. We were like okay how would we go about distributing and discovering the skills and so sort of the idea became very complete and that's where a tool like Vzero really helps you because when you want to extract it out of your mind you can just vero it and so pretty much what you see today it started with a like four or five vzero prompts in a conversation with our VP of design who then took it way further and made it actually good and um and uh our our CTO and our and our product leader. So you mentioned about BMs, is there a possibility of having React Native in Visero? >> So what you saw today is if you if you if you pee the covers of how Vero is built is built on a bunch of Verscell infrastructure that you also all have access to the the virtual machine that we use to run that Nex.js preview is called sandbox. So the Verscell sandbox and it's a very powerful computer. In fact, what's actually making agents really capable is not that they're perfect, is that they have a computer at their disposal in order to solve every any problem. So, the reason we showed you a glimpse of how we work internally with DZ. The reason DZero is so good at data analysis is that it has a computer where it can do research, it can write Python code, it can run it, it can make a look up to Snowflake, it can search the web, it can come back, it can fix it. It's like it's like a four or five minute process, right? And so these computers are very powerful general purpose computers. You could imagine them running React Native. You could imagine them writing other programming languages. They can obviously already write Python and run it. And so the sky's is the limit from that perspective. >> I have a question on that topic. Is there going to be a point at which Vzero is going to help you build those agents? >> Oh, absolutely. So the main the main idea of this chess thing, it's cute, but I mentioned the word workflow. So it's actually tricky for me to say this program is going to run forever in the presence of network or compute failures. So in fact like uh you know we're doing this live and just randomly came up with the idea. The reason I had confidence the demo was going to work is that if an LLM provider is down or a function call dies or times out or whatever the workflow engine of our cell will say we're doing live. We're going to try it again and we're going to try it again and we're going to try it again. What we're going to help you do is create those kind of workflows from within v 0ero. A lot of agents need that kind of reliability. For example, you send a message from Slack and you say at player GBT go and spec out this PRD for me. >> Yeah, it's called at chatp. It is running on workflows and >> yes, we didn't rehearse this. >> Yeah. So we we do have we do have uh I I feel the pain on on agents where um workflows are really helpful because they give you durable overtime execution. You can retry things, things can fail, you can do them sequentially, you can do all sorts of things. And so I do think the ability for you to build that on the back end is very helpful for even for applications that don't have the same kind of UI that you would have it >> because some are some are very visual and some are going to be more headless like some are going to be background agents that are doing work for you. In fact, the world is excited about the artists formerly known as Cladbot. Yeah. >> Moldbot. I don't know what moldbot means, by the way. >> Well, uh, crustaceians, this is how you know you have kids in like elementary schools. crustaceians like lose their shell so they mold. >> Moles are right. >> It's like a snake. >> Yeah, got it. >> And then emerge to steal your bank account. >> But so that's a beautiful example of the background thing, right? Because you text it and it does a bunch of stuff for you and then it responds. So that that's the kind of thing that we want you to be able to build with Vzero where it's going to use workflows. It might use sandbox and it might be more I think moldbot is like super general. It can do anything and even hack your computer but uh I I I expect a lot of really cool agents to to work that way like you just WhatsApp them and we'll we'll help you build those with Vzero and >> and the last thing I actually deployed on Versell was my live moltbot conversation. If you want to see >> what it is terminal >> I well I I shut the computer and walked away. I did not enjoy my it was an interesting experience. You can smash that subscribe button if you want to watch it. >> But I did I did deploy to Verscell >> a terminal view of my conversation with Mulbot. So you can go it's like it's called >> confessions. >> Yeah. Oh that's exactly what it is. Yeah. It's real scary >> app. >> Great. Maybe one more question. >> Oh wow. What an honor. First of all, thank you so much uh for hosting the event. Thank you so much for the new VZero. I I ship a lot with Vzero. My co-founder is using Cursor and now we have like a mutual compatibility. >> We're so back. >> Love it. >> There you go. Um and so I wanted to um again I'm also a Vzero ambassador. There we go. Let's go. Um I wanted to ask two questions. number one um a little bit different but when do you think so VZero has really democratized the ability to go from prompt to UI UI that works uh and UI that satisfies like the the the prompt that the user created when do you think that paradigm is going to happen within consumer in Gen UI uh I see that your team has been playing with a bunch of different libraries different ways to create that uh when do you think that switch is happening and then the second question when can I uh write a prompt and then deploy to the app store. >> Yeah. So on the on the first question, sometimes you're going to want like a flash v0ero. So we're playing with ideas around generative UI where an agent might decide to render something and think of it as like spontaneously creating an a the UI code and then rendering it right away. You're not actually creating a code and an application and deploying it. You just want to make it happen. So we're doing a lot of research on like what would that look like? So it's another tool that we can give agents on the app store question you've seen some of the stuff that we've been doing with vzero iOS app react native skills a long held dream of ours has been to really democratize pushing to the apps are like you would push to the web and everything here is like sort of using that same those same ingredients uh reactbased deployment platform just deploy with one press of a button and whatnot. So, uh, yeah, don't want to promise any timelines, but, uh, definitely something we want to do. >> Thank you. Thanks everybody. Thanks so much for watching.

    "transcript": "MCPS, I will say it's a concept that's really hard to understand for folks. >> Yeah, definitely don't think about the word. It really just is like app integrations for your AI tools. You can create these collections of tools from all the apps you use and give them access to Claude to Chatbt to Cursor, all the places that have inputs for MCP servers today. >> I use agents all the time, but it is hard to break that muscle memory of this is a deterministic workflow versus an instructive agent. even if it has access to the same tools and can do the same things. >> And when it comes down to it, the two things we see people wanting to do is one, giving their favorite AI tool the access to knowledge that lives in their apps as well as giving them the ability to actually do things in those apps. Those are the two things that if that sounds like something that you need in an AI app you use, look for MCP or connectors as it's often being called now as well for that. >> [music] >> Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I'm talking to Reed Robinson, product manager on AI at Zapier. And what I love about my conversation with Reed is he's going to show us how to put MCPs to work inside Claude to take over tasks that you really hate. We also talk about whether AI can be the perfect always on team that works while you sleep and some use cases to make your kids and your partner a little happier. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. [music] AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets [music] automatically. But there's a catch. These tools only work well when they have deep access to company systems. Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that [music] raises serious security concerns. That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, access controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise [music] features. Building all that from scratch, it's a massive lift. That's where Work OS comes in. Work OS gives you [music] drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale [music] up market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, [music] and Cursor are already using work OS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at workos.com. Start building today. Hey Reed, thanks for joining how I AI. Thanks for having me here, Claire. Excited to chat today. >> What I love about how you've described your role at Zapier, which I use all the time, I say is like loadbearing infrastructure over at Chat PRD, is you've you've worked your way into a role where you get to kind of like pick what you're working on next in in AI. And so I'd love to hear about what you're focused on and how that's actually impacted how you think some about some of your personal workflows. >> Absolutely. So yeah, the way I often describe my role is often like sisophist of AI at Zapier just pushing the rock up the hill wherever that rock may be and whatever the hill might be. Right now the thing I'm most excited about and where I'm choosing to spend a lot of my time working on AI is on our approach to MCPs. Uh so we've got you know a server approach but as well as what we're doing on the client side. you know, MCPs, I will say, uh, still, I think, un both kind of very hyped and underutilized by people. Um, because I think it's a it's a concept that's really hard to understand for folks. So, I'd encourage our listeners and our watchers who are a little nervous about waiting into the world of MCPs to just really think about, you know, if I could give my favorite AI chat client or IDE or whatever access to a bunch of tools to do things for me, um, what would I want them to do and then go hunt for an MCP that that does that thing. And I think you have have built a product that has tried to abstract away some of that complexity for Zapier users at least. Could you walk us through kind of a little bit of your approach there? >> Yeah, absolutely. And I I think you said it really well. The two kind of use cases I give people to just like I don't know think about MCPS is Yeah, definitely don't think about the word. It really just is like app integrations for your AI tools. And when it comes down to it, the two things we see people wanting to do is one giving their favorite AI tool access to knowledge that lives in their apps as well as giving them the ability to actually do things in those apps. So, it's really those are the two things that if like that sounds like something that you need in an AI app you use, look for MCP or connectors as it's often being called now as well uh for that. And yeah, the approach that Zapier took for anybody not familiar with Zapier. Uh we're like uh one of the world's largest AI orchestration automation platforms. And what that really means on the MCP side is we've got 8,000 apps on Zapier that are like every SAS app you can imagine. There's 30,000 searches and actions amongst that. And that's all exposed via Zapier MCP. So you can create these like collections of tools from all the apps you use and give them access to claude to chatbt to cursor to all the places that have kind of inputs for MCP servers today. >> Do you mind pulling that up and just showing us a little bit of what that that looks like? And while you're pulling up your screen, I do bless you MCP framework provider. Um, but we gota work we got to work on the branding here. So I think your description is exactly right like app connectors for for your AI is such a simpler way for the everyday consumer to understand this. Um, and so okay so you're showing us Zapier here for folks that are just listening and just can you walk through in oh you have 8,000 tools that or 8,000 apps you can add tools from. So this is your MCP server that you've added a custom set of tools that you're going to use pretty consistently either for a use case or just as a as an individual, right? >> Yeah, exactly. And so the way that it works is I kind of set up the ones that I'm using specifically for Claude. Uh and so what's nice on Zapier side unlike many other MCP servers is we actually are more like a platform for creating servers. So you can create multiple and what that means is you can create specific sets of tools to use with claude or with a particular agent or with chatbt or with cursor uh really anything out there that supports it. Um, which is nice cuz for me those tools are different from one place to the other. And yeah, you can see or for those who can't see, uh, you can add tools from things like Slack, Evernotes, Glean, Koda, Google Calendar, and you can actually start to customize those tools as well. Um so whether you want to like restrict them to using certain uh databases like I've done with Kod I for my use within claude I really I'm using it for particular documents and particular sheets for instance um and other sides like with Evernote I want to restrict it to writing to certain notebooks. Uh so it really allows you to like customize the way you want your tool to work in different places. uh which is quite nice because then it's like a single URL to give over to Claude and connect to. And now if I switch over to Claude here, uh you can see that Claude now has like a single Zapier connector, but in that Zapier connector is like all of the different tools that I want Claude to be able to access. >> Yeah. Yeah. And one of the things that I'll call out for the sort of more advanced MCP users and a challenge that I've always had is when you're adding these individual MCP, like there's a Google calendar MCP and I'm sure there's a KOD MCP is when you're adding these individual ones, you kind of have to do that configuration at the provider level. Um, and what I like about this approach is like this custom collection of tools is actually a really nice way to think about the MCP tools that you need. Um, either just in general or for a specific use case. And then for um, MCP clients out there, I just I think we're going to need at some point more and I know you're working on this, but like you just need more granular control over tools pri I mean like priority. I think of tool calling is really important. I have um two MCPs that I use really frequently in cursor and they're always like competing for which one I'm trying to call because I say it's like it's like search projects. Everything has projects in it. Always calls the wrong wrong MCP. And so I do think like the the meta abstractions around MCPS are going to start being more important as they become more adopted. So that's Claire's uh manifesto on MCP MCP design. All right. So, you have this custom MCP. I mean, what are specific things this unlocks for you? So, what use cases are are you using here to actually get more work done? >> Yeah. So, for me, there's like things that I don't love doing um is really where it helps me. Uh so, one like and for one of the things you just touched on, which is like the model's ability today to pick which tool is a bit murky. Um I think Claude is a phenomenal place. They've done a great job with tool calling. One of the tricks for anybody listening uh check out cloud projects. Uh in particular, one of the things that you can do in cloud projects is provide very like detailed instructions for use cases. And so for instance, I'll show I'll share my screen here, but I have one that's all about the way I like logging and looking up data from CRM from our CRM for things. And I've actually told it like how it should use tools, in which order it should use tools, what data should go where when it's creating records in those with those tools. And it when so then in Claude when I'm trying to do things, I can actually be like, oh, I'm doing a CRM thing. I'm actually going to go ahead and select my CRM project and then shoot over a message. And now Claude's ability to like execute across many different tools sequentially uh is so much better. Uh, so I'd highly recommend if anybody's like running into those things, try out projects. Um, highly recommend it. >> Yeah, I've heard a lot of people talk about using cloud projects for knowledge, like loading it up with knowledge, but I haven't heard anybody talk about what you specifically gave as an example, which is use cloud projects to give specific instructions relative to MCP tool usage and a workflow. And so folks, listen up. You can do that in cloud projects um and probably other clients to just make your your use of your tools more efficient. Okay, so you have this cloud project. It looks like one of the things you hate doing is updating your CRM. Um like like a true account. [laughter] Um I I I do actually tell people um MCPs are highly underappreciated by customerf facing teams. Like what what do customerf facing teams hate doing? updating Salesforce, we hate it. We hate it. And so like, you know, keeping good customer records, whether it's for a sales use case, a research use case, whatever, is like really tedious and they're actually amazing MCPs out there to do this. So, uh, I love to see how how this works in your flow. >> Yeah, absolutely. So, we know first one of the first things I do is I have my daily planning one and that actually like goes through my full calendar and one of the nice things is I've given it access to like internal uh lookup tools. So, for instance, when I run this, it can actually look up the person I'm meetings with, uh, Zapier usage, their company's Zapier usage, our past sales interaction with them, and it's able to like follow the process of doing all that lookup, and then when it comes back with ultimately my daily update, it has all of that research included. So, again, really one that I've helped a lot of our sales team uh, get set up with, and we've actually been like demoing it uh, when we go to like events. Uh, that's been pretty fun. But yeah, on the CRM side, so let's say that I have the biggest one for me is actually my like postmeating notes management. Uh I I'm a big fan of Granola. They're a great tool. Uh but I struggle with the fact that sometimes I don't want to log those notes or I don't do it all the time. Um or it can just be really tedious to go about doing that. And so one of the things that I found really helpful here is I can I have like a cloud project that has a bunch of instructions on just how to log this data, where should it log, and then I can go in and actually select that project. Um, and then what it can do is it should be a it'll have access to all the tools and it'll start like running it through uh for this. And now this one's going to be interesting because I'm I have the project configured to like our production database and it's going to try it with a different one. So let's see if this works for that. But it should be checking against this kod document uh for things and seeing like what are the interviews I have scheduled and what are the things that are coming up. And if I go back to my little buddy claude here, it's going to tell me that sure enough nothing was found. Uh then it can choose to, you know, start doing additional things where I've taught it to like use our internal lookup to find this person's thing. Uh I'm going to skip this for now. Don't want to pull in actual stuff here. And then some other things is glean. Like now I've given it an action uh as well to search like our internal Glean uh tool which is awesome because then I could see like oh well we talked about this customer in Slack or we had notes from the CSM on what this meeting's supposed to be about. So it helps do a lot of that. And then eventually what it gets into doing is start to say like, okay, this didn't exist. Here's what I looked up based on the notes from the meeting. Like, let me go create that and run with it. >> And that updates your KOD with what? >> Ah, so yeah, that updates the COD with like and this is I'm doing a demo in here for y'all. Um, essentially like the KOD that I do have is a lot of the times I work on some of our like new products or new features. I'm doing like customer research in these like smaller dedicated sprints. And so we typically will have something in KOD. I might also need to update our actual CRM which will use HubSpot as well. So I'd have that as like an additional tool to log it as an activity on the meeting. But for the most part, I'm making sure that I have a record of this meeting. Uh who I met with, what if there were next steps, what were the next steps. Uh it'll include some details on like what is if there's a bigger opportunity, like what are the opportunity details. um you can really get it to include a lot of things. And I think that's where if I go back to the prompt for a second, uh things like this here where you'll see I t I kind of like I don't know our users always say they train the model. So if that makes sense to you, you can train the model uh on how to populate your CRM fields because everybody's CRM fields are unique, right? Like nobody uses uh standard cookie cutter CRM for the most part. Um folks love their custom fields. Um, but models don't know what those custom fields are and what those choices are. So, great way again just to get it to be familiar with you and working specifically for you. >> What I think is really interesting here again as like a power Zapier user is I have a similar flow which is I take granola transcripts. I use the granola um app in Zapier but I have mapped this out in the standard workflow builder. So I have done the I think now that I'm seeing this the inefficient task of saying okay like if this look up this record if the record doesn't exist do that if the record does exist do this and so I have this like very similar CRM record updating flow in Zapier um but it's very step-by-step kind of like deterministic workflow and what I like about this and I should be doing better because I'm supposed to be like fairy godmother of AI I you can actually just in natural language describe that flow and I know this I use agents all the time but it is hard to break that muscle memory of like this is a you know a deterministic workflow versus an instructive agent even if it has access to the same tools and can do the same things. And so have you found that one one path or the other is more or less brittle? Meaning like is is this actually more resilient this sort of like MCP agentic instructions piece more resilient to the complexities of your data or do you find that it fails more or less than like kind of these nice uh netted out workflows? >> Yeah, it's a very good question. I think the on the kind of reliability or where they fail, they're they've got their like pros and cons. The pros of doing things like asynchronously is certainly things can take longer. Uh like one of the biggest challenges right now with MCP stuff is they just they can't take that long. Um and so if you have like a lookup process that might take like seven minutes, like that's not going to work here. uh where that does you can start to do a lot more of that in like deterministic workflow land so to speak. Um the other big thing though to be honest like the distinction that I that what it really boils down to cuz Zapier also has an agents product where you could do this as an agent thing but really what this boils down to is just giving the tools giving the knowledge and the ability to take actions to the all the AI apps where you use them. It's kind of like the old product thing about like you know meeting your user where they are right uh right place right time and I have found that that is probably the biggest thing because there are so many times where I am you know like if for anybody with keen eyes you would have saw one of the projects I have here is actually even like idea jammer I have a whole project dedic hooked up to different tables and stuff like that for myself when I'm just like jamming on a topic and it then will like research like have we explored similar ideas or where might this be relevant and it has more train more like uh prompting there to like challenge me and certain methodologies to challenge me on that. So, it really boils down to just like meeting people. And I'll be clear like one of the things we're seeing though from like enterprises that are that are adopting this is the fact that they're trying to make sure that these tools work for all of their employees like automatically so that if they've rolled out claw for the entire organization when they log in and they connect to appear it like has the tools that they should need for their role that it's created by some like ops admin or someone. Yeah. >> Um, and that's been really powerful. >> As an AI founder, you're used [music] to sprinting towards product market fit, your next round, or that first enterprise contract. But speed [music] isn't enough for AI startups. Buyers expect security, compliance, and transparency from day one. That's why serious AI startups use [music] Vanta. With deep integrations and automated workflows built for fastm moving AI teams, Vanta gets you audit [music] ready fast and keeps you secure with continuous monitoring as your models, [music] infra, and customers evolve. AI innovators like Langchain, Writer, and Cursor [music] scaled faster and closed bigger deals by getting security right early with Vanta. [music] Listeners can claim a special offer of $1,000 off Vanta at vanta.comhowi. There are pros and cons to each. You know, you mentioned three different methodologies. There's MCPs put in like the client where you're actually working. There's agents which do some of this and like sort of a native client. Then there's these deterministic workflows and you do have a workflow that does use AI within a more deterministic flow. So do you want to walk us through through that one and just talk about why you selected this kind of model of implementation for this particular use case? >> Yeah, absolutely. So one of the things for me again I like prep for a lot of customer interviews and we have a lot of data and sometimes one of the most embarrassing things for me or it feels embarrassing is when I get on a call with a customer and they're like just a user interview that may have booked it via LinkedIn. They may have booked it via a referral from someone at a partner, right? Like they come in from all over the place. Like my Calendarly link seems to like spread um decently wide. And sometimes I'll get on a call previously and I'd be like, I don't know who you are. I don't know if your company uses Zappier. I don't know if they, you know, and sometimes they're like, oh yeah, we're both a customer and a uh partner, right? And I'm like, whoops. I didn't know that. Um and so what I and what I worked with and our salesfacing team had similar issues. And so one of the first things that we did was we used data bricks which houses like a lot of our data and makes that usable. And so they built like this whole series of things that allows like just simple lookup for you know given an email address come back with like a whole write up of it. And so essentially this is a fancy looking workflow. Uh but the gist of it is that forever the meetings that I'm having it goes out fetches that like research lookup which takes time and then it deciphers that into a like it uses actually a Gemini step since it handles my like the the document type that I was working with and creates the or appends it technically to the KOD page for that customer interview. And so this is really helpful for me again because it's just like now when I'm going into my meetings, I get things like this where this is also where I'll like take some of my notes. Um, and so I can actually see like, oh, how they did use it and get some really like crisp things uh to walk into the meeting knowing. And I think for anybody especially in bigger companies like one of the biggest challenges we consistently see is they just like they're using when they start to use AI they're using like the base models with like no additional context aheaded and so the unlocks for them often become how do you get your whole sales team to not only like use AI to log things but also like fetch information from their CRM and from their data systems uh when and where they need it. Um, and that becomes really cool because, you know, technically I could then throw like data bricks lookups into an MCP tool and put that to claude. Um, gets really funky. Uh, those typically take too long though. >> Yeah. Well, if you are uh the AI sophist, one of the things I might recommend and I think you probably would as well is you like buddy buddy buddy up to the data engineering team. That's for sure. Um, because that's a really useful source of interesting rich information. And then one other thing I want to call out that may have zipped by people, especially those that are listening, is if you go into your user context zap that you just showed us, you chose Google Gemini. And I just want to reiterate why. Um, because I've heard this a lot from different different guests, which is the Google models in particular are just like great at files. They love a file. They're it's it's great at files. So Gemini um really good at large files, files, context, video files, audio files. And so anytime you have sort of like a filebased um challenge ahead of you or or use case, I see a lot of um AI power users reaching for the Gemini models, is that what drove this particular use case? >> Yep, you nailed it. >> Um yeah, the output from our data team is actually to date a PDF. >> Um and so it works very well. um with that actually it's HTML that was the what so I convert the HTML to a file because then it works really really well um and a lot less tokens which is nice >> yeah I mean it's interesting the ascendancy of the markdown file for you know the open AAI and anthropic models or chat GPT and claude and I do think Gemini has taken this like side angle where it's like you know you but if you have a PDF or if you have some other file format where where where your model so I I think it's really interesting for folks who want to go to the next level of implementation. Again, to not only feed rich context into their AI use cases, but also really understand a couple of the highle nuances of the major commercial models, so you're picking the right one because I I would guess you'd get a worse output with a with a different model just because of the the data input. Okay, that is super super useful. And then um so you've talked a lot about customer interactions, right? CRM updates, meetings, but you also get a lot of asynchronous customer feedback. Um, including from me and shout out, uh, whoever is on the receiving end of my support and product feedback tickets. Thank you. I appreciate you. You're always really, really responsive. How do you drive that responsiveness using AI or systematically across a pretty large customer footprint? >> Yeah, it's fun. Um there's a lot of things I I'll walk through one of the things I have found impactful especially with like our newer products that we're pushing out. Um one thing I'll say I I can't show this but again does work with data and getting better relationships with data engineering. Um I think when we've started to like unlock more and more capabilities with with data on that front as well. Uh like with MCP just this week our team got to the point where we're now properly like analyzing a lot of feedback and actually creating uh pages in KOD for review uh for things for our team as we walk in based on like new trends that are emerging amongst the data uh automatically uh which is quite fun. But one of the things that we've also done here that really helps is just like making it more searchable for folks. Uh this is really helpful for like not even the core build team that's working on the product, but when I'm working with uh for instance like sales or I'm working with PMM uh that are supporting us with launches, they'll often have questions of like, hey, what feedback have we been receiving lately? Or like are people doing this sort of use case? Right? and they're just they have very specific questions or they're trying to understand something. Um or it's the designer who as we're diving into a topic, we want to like really quickly surface uh times where users have had uh issues with the like error log system and they want to like find like hey can we find that? And so created like a little chatbot here uh that essentially just like it's really simple but it it is fed with a bunch of like databases essentially and then just like makes that really easily searchable right um it's a standard chatbot rag type thing I won't go into it um in much detail but it's like internally locked down for us um and all those things which is really helpful um and and we also use this sort of system externally as well so like you'll And one of the things that we do here is I have our MCP helper chatbot transcripts. And so I have this kind of like enduserfacing chatbot. And you'll see it it has these like knowledge sources which are basically just like our help docs as well as one uh table which is like a Google sheet type thing. It's our sappier world of that. And I I love this little system and I'll just talk for a second. Uh and it's really just you know for anybody that's working with data and knowledge management things. it's difficult to keep it up to date and I found myself previously constantly like trying to go back to our knowledge sources that these these bots had and just like trying to manually keep it up to date on like a monthly or quarterly basis. Uh but one system I ended up finding that worked really well for me is I built um like one there's a zap somewhere that essentially every time there is a closed uh support ticket or if there's a a finished chatbot transcript it analyzes the conversation and tries to say like what is the core FAQ from this like what was the core issue what was the solution if any and is that already in the knowledge base that we had if not please propose an entry and so what I then do is I have my like human step here where I can actually review the FAQs that it wants to submit and all I have to do to I can edit it as well like what the answer is and if I approve it it goes over to a different database which is the one that the bot is actually using. Um so a really nice way that I have found consistently now on a number of projects just to like rapidly iterate and keep those things up to date so that users are just getting like their answers faster. Uh which is really nice. Yeah. Well, what what I like about this is I often tell people who are trying to figure out use cases of AI or implement AI solutions is they really get stuck on like the I'm doing X. How do I use AI to continue to do X or do X faster, whatever? And that's fine. I think that's a like I I I'm already taking meetings. How do I make taking those meetings a little easier? But the challenge I often give people is let's say you had the perfect team with infinite time. What are the things your perfect team with infinite time would do in anyone's and your perfect support team with infinite time would look at every support question and would go see do we have the right help desk content here and if we don't let's write great content and then let's publish it and then let's put that in the chat like in an ideal but none of us live in ideal worlds we're super busy and so I think this is like a really good example of that where it allows you to operate at a next level of quality, not just like velocity, but a next level of quality. And then again, like the more highquality data you create, the more you can power interesting AI solutions to your customers like chat bots. And so, um, you know, again, anybody out there looking like if I had a full-fledged team of SDRs that were perfect and had infinite time, what would I do? Or like, you know, 10,000 support people with infinite time, what would I do? like start to think about those use cases and don't forget to to pluck those off because I think they can unlock some interesting ideas inside your team and then let your team act as higher leverage folks. I >> like the way you put that. The the other I don't know if it helps ever to anybody, but the other way I often tell folks that are struggling with that is like if you could run chatbt in your sleep, what would you do is you know I found a really good way to help people start brainstorming ideas. I will say as like a maybe aside on that on the product design world, uh we found we did one experiment really early on um that was kind of like Mad Libs to help discover use cases and stuff and it was a very interesting experiment in that it seemed to actually help people discover what they wanted to do but it also challenged them to think through like what their pain points were and it was really fascinating uh just to to experience. So, uh, for anybody looking at that in their products, try a Mad Libs style, uh, AI enabled system to like ask questions and ask follow-up questions with free form text. >> Just to kind of take a step back and walk through what you what you showed us today, we have MCPs. Um, Zapier MCPS in particular can give you a really custom set of tools to call. You like Claude, you like using Claude projects to give instructions on tool calling sequence and instructions so you get really high quality outputs of that. And then you're really focused on um I heard you say very early on in the episode avoiding things you hate which is like all of us updating the CRM. Um you know attending what we all attend which are just in time meetings, right? you just get out of the next meeting and you you show up in the next one without context. So, making sure you're prepped for that. And then kind of this virtuous cycle of customer feedback, support feedback, FAQs, um you know, internal input, and then customerf facing uh help content as kind of a a happy happy circle here. And so, I think this is great for anybody who's spending a lot of time with customers, whether you're in sales or support or product. um to be better prepared um and and get stuff done with less tabs open in your browser, which is what we all want. Well, uh Reed, I'm going to we're going to do a couple lightning round questions and then we'll get you out of here back to um pushing the boulder up the hill. My first question for you is we've seen a lot of business use cases. What are like your favorite personal use cases? like what are ones that have really surprised you either by making you know really how sparking joy or just really solving a problem personally? >> Yeah, I'll touch on two real fast. Number [clears throat] one, in terms of solving a problem, family calendar planning. Uh for anybody that has kids and families, like family calendar, it's a real thing. Um and for me, the struggle is uh my my wife and I both like a physical calendar in the house and we're reluctant to get like a full digital frame thing. Um, so we have a physical one that we write things on, but I like live by Google calendar. And if it's really not my Google calendar, it like doesn't exist. Um, and particularly if it's a family event that's in the middle of the like a normal day, then someone can book a meeting over and that's really not good. And so I actually have a claw project called family calendar. It has really detailed instructions on it's not too detailed but it basically tells it like which calendar to look at uh how to add things if it's an event that's at my son's school or somewhere to leave time in my calendar to drive there and drive back if it's you know during the business hours. Uh so that that is blocked. And now what I do is like occasionally I just take a picture of the physical calendar and then it uses the various like find and update and create actions for Google calendar through Zapium MTP and just like does all of it. Um and I love that. Um that's probably like one of the greatest things. Uh other than that these days uh they had a big V5 update recently. I have been loving it with my son and his other like friends in our neighborhood. Uh we've made a lot of songs together. I literally just like talked to Claude and I was like, \"Hey Claude, you're gonna write a kid song for my son Leo. He's four. Here's what we did today.\" And I just like told it what we did. And my son insisted that it have poop and fart jokes in it as well. And so I was like, \"Well, you need to have some poop and fart jokes.\" Um, and my son has listened to this at least on Suno alone 14 times. Uh we gave it to one of his babysitters and she they listen to together like non-stop for an hour. Um and we've done this with like his friends and they've made songs for each other and it's really fun and it's the other thing too is like some of the older kids nearby like uh one of the girls like 10 almost 10 and she's been learning about like prompting through this because she was like oh it said this but like that's not right. I and I was like well you got to be specific in this and you got to like instruct it. And so I have I gave them like a a whiteboard with a dry erase marker and they're just like writing out their little prompts. Um and then I input them for them. Um and so that's been a lot of fun and I think I don't know hopefully a little bit educational. >> I have to I have to just uh bring us back to our starter topic which is does Sunno have an MCP? >> That's good. >> Team I I am also a uh extreme Puno power user. Love it. And imagine imagine you could take your customer prep meeting and just give yourself like a friendly jingle to remember what they're talking. >> You laugh. But I've actually I did that with I took our I took our MCP sales training session. I actually took the transcript from Zoom along with the deck and I gave it to Claude and I said come up with a pop song I think for this >> and I've actually shared it and a couple of our like sales team and product team have actually listened to it and really liked it. Um I mean yeah we we teach kids with music and humans have been I don't know music people much longer than we've been reading people. Um so it's it's fun uh to explore that. I might I might have you beat which is I took a incident postmortem for like an engineering incident and then made it was like a punk song about how we needed to solve the root cause issues. Um and it was called Renew theerts. It was it's a very it's a b it's a b certified banger. So um we'll have to put a playlist together and put it in the show notes. Okay. And then there's one last use case which I love. I want to make sure we spend a couple minutes on it with notebook LM. >> Yeah, this one I I think Notebook LM I use personally for learning. Uh, I put like a lot of things in it to learn, but I got one that I got a lot of value from, uh, and a lot of brownie I bonus husband points from with my wife. Uh, which was she was recently like job searching. And what I did for her on all of them was like when she got the interview, I would take their like careers page. I would take the job thing. I would find like more information. And I had like a prompt I used for the audio overview that was like, \"You are preparing Anna for this interview. Like make sure it's specific to Anna.\" and she listened to all of these before and she like constantly got feedback throughout the process that she was like the most informed applicant. She clearly understood the space cuz I, you know, would always tell like talk about the competitors, what they're doing in the marketing world and what are trends going on there. Um, and she loved that it was also like so Anna, we're going to prepare you today. It was really cute. Um, but it worked exceptionally well for her. um she ended up getting like the ideal job that she really wanted. Um and yeah, it was pretty awesome. So, highly recommend that. It's also great bonus points for anybody out there with friends, family, interviewing, um the ways that you can really help them. >> Okay, I'm going to have to make hats, which is like my love language is personalized AI podcasts. It's very good. It's very good. Husbands out there, uh, wives out there, partners out there, demonstrate your love by doing knowledge work via AI for the things that your your partner needs. Okay, this is this is amazing. This is really fun. Um, so many tabs opened in the sidebar. I'm sure so many other things you could show, Reed. Thanks for joining. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Yeah, where you can find me, LinkedIn. I'm most active on LinkedIn. Um, I do love the LinkedIn. Uh, so you can find me Reed Reid Robinson um on LinkedIn. You'll probably find me pretty quick. Um, if you can help, honestly, I'm a sucker for product feedback. Like, try some of the things I've talked about today. Tell me what worked. Tell me what didn't work. Tell me what you wish existed. Um, I also love hearing from the folks who are thinking about the future of all of this. Um, who've tried like wacky things and they're like, \"Hey, if only I could do this.\" Um, I'd love that. like bigger picture thinking stuff as well. So if you've got some like wacky ideas in the world of tools and agents and automation stuff, let me know. If not, yeah, try Zap your MCP. Give us some feedback. Would love any and all. >> Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Reed. I really appreciate it. >> Really appreciate you having me on Claire. >> Thanks so much for watching.

(In the time since this was recorded, the tool was renamed Moltbot, but we’re calling it Clawdbot here to match the episode.) It’s an autonomous AI that can run code, spin up sub-agents, join video calls, and take real actions on your machine. I invite it onto the podcast, give it screen access, and walk through what it’s like to go from zero to one with an agentic AI that actually does things. Along the way, I share the real experience: installation headaches, dependency chaos, security warnings you shouldn’t ignore, and the very real tension of giving an AI access to your messaging apps, files, and accounts. I also break down how I thought about permissions, identity, model choice, and cost while testing Clawdbot as a personal assistant.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. How to install and set up Clawdbot (and why it’s not as simple as the “one-liner” suggests)\n2. The security implications of giving an autonomous AI access to your computer and accounts\n3. How to safely limit Clawdbot’s permissions while still making it useful\n4. Why Clawdbot struggles with basic time concepts but excels at research tasks\n5.

    "transcript": "All right, we're gonna start this episode by actually inviting Claudebot to the podcast via Telegram. Let's see how it goes. Hey Paulie, can you please join my Riverside FM podcast? All right, I sent the voice message and it's not getting it. This is the most stressful thing I've ever done. Hello. Oh, it's doing it. [laughter] Finally listened. Okay, it is opening Riverside on Chrome. This is horrifying in every way. I'm going to allow it permissions for my my microphone and my camera, which also makes me extremely nervous. >> Hey Claire, the Riverside link keeps taking me to an upload page that says uploading 100% instead of a guest join interface. >> This is my entire experience using this product. Just will it work? Will it won't? Okay, it is opening Chrome for the fifth time. This is very scary. I see myself right now. I don't know if you all see me yet. And there we go. We are sharing an autonomous AIS full screen. No big deal. This episode is brought to you by Lovable. If you've ever had an idea for an app but didn't know where to start, Lovable is for you. Lovable lets you build working apps and websites by simply chatting with AI. Then you can customize it, add automations, and deploy it to a live domain. [music] It's perfect for marketers spinning up tools, product managers prototyping new ideas, or founders launching their [music] next business. Unlike Noode tools, Lovable isn't about static [music] pages. It builds full apps with real functionality, and it's fast. What used to take weeks, months, or even years, you can now do over the [music] weekend. So, if you've been sitting on an idea, now's the time to bring it to life. [music] Get started for free at lovable.dev. That's lovable.dev. We are live with a autonomous AI crustation now running video on my podcast. So, welcome Pauly the Clawbot. Let's get to our episode today. I am ClaVo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. I am also on a mission to try every single new hot AI tool taking over your timeline. And in case you missed it this week, it is Claudebot, recently renamed Moltbot, the Cristian that people are yoloing root access to. Cloudbot is an open-source AI agent that you can install on a virtual machine or on a desktop or laptop that you have access to that is self-learning, can spin up sub agents using Claude code and other agent harnesses and can do in my lived experience a lot of damage. People are loving Claudebot for what it unlocks in terms of personal productivity. People are hating Claudebot in terms of security and the high high high high likelihood you're going to do something real dumb with it. This is a AI tool that I want you to know how it works, what it can do, and maybe some thoughts on the future of personal AI agents and enterprise AI agents. So today's episode is all about Claudebot and my experience going 0ero to one with this tool. Okay. So just a couple things to know about Claudebot. It is pitched as AI that actually does things and it does do things including joining podcasts, but it's really positioned as something that can help you dayto-day with tasks. And the killer use case for it and the killer feature for it is you can as we've seen do it from your phone. And so if you want to WhatsApp, Telegram, iMessage, Claude Code and get it to do things for you, that is what Claudebot does. And you know, a lot of people are under the mistaken impression that I have to um correct right now, which is you need a Mac Mini or some sort of fancy hardware to use Claudebot. You do not. Claudebot does run locally, but it can run um on your machine or it can run in the cloud. You can set it up for five bucks on Amazon. Um we'll do some notes on security if you're running it in the cloud, making sure that people don't have access to. But you do not need special hardware. It is not doing anything super fancy. Unless you're running mega mega mega local models, you really just don't need new hardware. If you want something shiny and fancy, go ahead. Feel free overnight it from the Apple store. Otherwise, you can run it on your machine. I'm running it on a MacBook Air that's sitting in on a shelf somewhere that I just picked up that no one was using. And I'm going to walk you through step by step how I set up my Claudebot. As somebody who's pretty paranoid about security and also wanted to test it as a real AI assistant. So, the first thing I did was I got out I'm actually just going to show you. I got out this little this laptop, this guy. Um, which is a newish one, but nothing fancy. And I gave it its own username on this laptop. Now, don't tell Claude I have another user on this laptop, which does make me nervous because Claudebot has access to your file system. In theory, it could definitely gain access to that other user. It's a really old user. I don't actually think I have that much on it. and I was testing Cloudbot in a pretty constrained way. But if I were to continue to use Claudebot, I'd probably delete everything out that old user and just make this a Claudebot machine. The second thing that I did was install a bunch of prerequisites and dependencies. So, as much as I love this quick start right here that says that you can just add one line in the terminal and get it installed, that was not my experience. even for a laptop that was like pretty fresh and new, I had to install some dependencies. It actually took me two hours to get this oneliner installed. So, I had to um upgrade Node. I had to install Homebrew. I had to install Xcode cuz Xcode wasn't installed on this. And then because Node and npm were out of date, I had to update those manually. And then finally actually installed it um just via npm. So that was my kind of overall experience installing. It took a little bit of time and my thought in installing was no sort of like consumer is going to go through this. This is definitely like a hacker tinkerer developer experience type tool right now. That being said, you can use claude code to install it. I've seen a couple people go that path, but I really wanted to do the 0ero to one. what does claude.bot bot say that we need to do to install this thing and then what is that experience like? Now after you install all your dependencies and then after you install it goes through this onboarding flow um that has you create gateway off and gateway tokens and the first thing that you're going to [laughter] see in cloudbot onboarding is security. So it points you to the security link. It says that this is powerful and inherently risky and you just yolo and you just say yes. That being said, I highly recommend you read through the security page and that you run the security audits before you use Claudebot. So the next step in onboarding is actually connecting Claudebot to whatever device you're going to use to contact it. So, I originally started with WhatsApp, but then I read the screen that said you should basically put WhatsApp on like a burner phone with its own SIM SOS. Like, don't do that. And so, I switched to Telegram, which I use for literally nothing. Um, because I'm an old lady mom, and set up a Telegram account. Now, to hook up Telegram, what you do is you message the BotFather, which again, this is like super shady stuff if you're a consumer and you don't know what you're doing and you never heard of Telegram and then you're told to go tobotfather to connect this to your machine, but I did it anyway. So, you message botfather and you say, you know, create new bot and you give it a name and you give it a handle. And then once you've done that, your Claudebot will see it. It will have a token and then you actually give Claudebot a personalized share token. That means that only your instance of Telegram can speak to the Claudebot. Remember, this is an open connection point to a machine that's running code with a bunch of access to things if you're using Clawbot to its full extent. So if somebody else is able to message your Claudebot, you are in trouble. It can do things like find secrets. It can send emails on your behalf. So you really want to make sure that the messaging system that you set up is locked down to only your phone, only your user. Now remember, phone gets stolen, it can connect into your Cloudbot, it's no good. But we're no one's going to steal my air um my MacBook Air yet except for my kids. Okay, so I'm paired on Telegram and now you can do the magic. So what did I do with Claudebot? Well, first I thought about what were the use cases that were most useful for me and then I thought very seriously about what and how I was going to give it access to things. So what I did, this was my choice is I wanted to test it as a personal assistant. You know, it says on the homepage it can clear your inbox, send emails, manage your calendar, check you in for flights, all this stuff. So, I have had EAS in the past. I know how to onboard an EA. So, my goal with using Claudebot was to really see how it would work as an EA. And when I have a new EA, I don't let them into my email. I don't give them password to my account. What I do is give them their own email address. So what I did and you can follow this if you want to from a security perspective although I think it has some drawbacks on the functionality of Cloudbot is I gave Cloudbot its own email address a Google Workspace email address and I gave that email address read access to my personal calendar to start and so the first thing that I wanted to do was give it the right accounts. The second thing I did which I've taken some inspiration from some people on X is I gave it access to its own limited vault on one password. So I use one password which is a password and secret sharing kind of app. I made a vault that's called Claude. Claude only has access. Claudebot only has access to that vault. And I started putting some passwords in there. None of these were passwords to anybody's accounts. They were passwords to Claude's own account and there was an anthropic API key in Claude's own account. One other thing that I should call out during onboarding that I didn't is when you are onboarding you can choose what model you want to use anthropic openai local models anything you want. I chose sonnet 45. You can also kind of use cloud code with your own subscription or through API. I chose to use it through API because I wanted to see how much I was spending on cloudbot and we'll get to that at the end of the episode. And why did I choose Sonnet 45 for this uh exercise? One, honestly, I was scared. I was very scared about what Opus would actually do. Like it's so powerful. Um it like kind of made me nervous. Two, I actually didn't think that the tasks that I was doing needed Opus. I just didn't think it needed the horsepower. Like it's sending emails. It's looking at calendars. It's not that complicated. And then the last thing is I wanted to control cost. So I was really unsure about how much token usage all these sub aents would take. And so I was really costconscious. I thought that users would be costconcious. I've heard a lot of people running local models or cheaper models. And so I wanted to use this kind of like a user would use it. And I selected sonnet 45 which is a perfectly serviceable model. Okay. So I gave it email access. I gave it um I gave it so an email. Now let's see what I started asking it to do. So the the next thing that it does when you're onboarding is it does this like bootstrap file and it walks you through a couple setup steps and in particular you're starting to load its personality and how it interacts with you. It asks you what should the bot call itself? Um, what is its personality like? Who are you? What's your time zone? Um, anything else you should know? And I called it Polly. It's an assistant. I want it to be professional but friendly. I like the the mermaid emoji, so I chose that. And it's updating updating its identity file. And then I said, \"Hey, I'm Claire. I'm founder of Chat PRD. You're going to help me with as a personal assistant across family and work tasks.\" And it updated my info. So now it kind of knows about, you know, who it is, who I am, how to contact. It gives me instructions on how to contact and then it, you know, connected me to my first task. Now, we had to go back and forth on some Telegram setup stuff. I'm going to skip that. And finally got a um response back from Telegram and we're going to do some scheduling tasks. you know, I was unsure on how Claudebot actually interacted with Google. And so I just asked it, you know, how do I give you access to this Google account and this Google calendar? And it's going to check how to set that up. And it gave me a couple steps to follow in terms of how to set up calendar access. Now, if you're a software engineer that has worked with Google APIs, you're probably familiar with this. But again, if you are kind of an everyday consumer or nontechnical person, you are going to have to get real familiar with the Google Cloud Console. You are going to have to set up API access, OOTH clients, a whole bunch of stuff. This did not take long because I have been personally victimized by the OOTH workflows of many integrations. I know exactly what to do here, but if you're not technical, you're going to have to start doing some technical things even to hook up your Google account. And this is actually simpler on a desktop. I'm going to show you why. It is much more complicated on a virtual machine. So just kind of understand that this step is not as straightforward one click as you can do. So what you do is you go into Google console, you turn on the docs API, you turn on the email API, you turn on the the calendar API, and then you download a JSON file of client secrets. Now, this legit stressed me out. This is not like the kind of thing you just kind of like yolo email and back back and forth. It still requires OOTH verification manually, but I was a little concerned about its like willingness to just say upload these files anywhere. I can download it. Don't worry, I'm going to share save it secretly. And you know, if you're not a software engineer or you haven't you you haven't been trained on best practices in terms of security principles, you would probably just like follow these instructions. And I you'll see this along my chat. I really questioned this along the way. Now, for this particular one, I just did it. It's like a sandbox account. I don't really care. I gave it a local path to the JSON credential files. They're configured and I gave it the email address that I had assigned it and sent that to them. And then it gives you this URL to authorize access. So this it gives you a URL to actually open up sign in to that new account and give it the permissions necessary and then it'll store those permissions locally. Now this is where I got a very interesting screen because if you recall my only intention with this task was to get it to look at the calendar and when I gave it permissions or when I went through the offflow it asked for this. It asked for the ability to basically see edit create and delete everything. delete, edit, see my files, see my contacts, see my spreadsheets, see my calendar events, see my email. And again, my is its account. So, in theory, this would have been okay. It was kind of like an empty state account. But that being said, I was just trying to do calendar stuff. And so, you will see here, I asked, do you really need all these scopes? And it gave me a classic AI. You are absolutely right. I do not need these scopes. and it reprompted me with that URL for just calendar scope. So, if I were to give you a tip, it is watch how and what scope permission you're giving for any of these services. And if you're asking for something specific, only give it scopes for something specific. And if it only needs read access, only give it read access. Just be really thoughtful here. So, I just asked for calendar access. No big deal. Set it up and it told me it can do a bunch of stuff. So what did I have it do? Okay, so we just talked back and forth like we were a assistant and its boss. It gave me a summary of what's going on in the upcoming week, what I had today, what I had tomorrow, what was going on this week. And so I gave it a task that I would have normally given an assistant, which is going to the V Vzero studio this week in San Francisco. I forgot to put it on my calendar. Like I don't remember. or can you look it up on the Verscell events page and put it on my calendar? And it couldn't actually find it on the blog and asked me some questions, gave me some options. Um, it did say that I could, if I wanted to be, you know, easy an easygoing boss, give it access to Gmail, but I definitely wasn't going to do that. And so after a little bit of back and forth, including some drop Telegram messages, I said, \"Let me give you email access to your own account and I'll forward you emails about it.\" So again, this is something that I would have done with a um EA. I would have just forward it and said, \"Can you add this to my calendar?\" No other contacts. Now, I did have to reauthorize access to its own email. Um so it went through that OOTH process again. It got the email. It ingested the event details from the email, which was really great, super helpful. It recommended things like adding buffer time for commute before and after, which is definitely what I needed. And I said that I wanted it to add that event to my calendar. Now, if you recall, it doesn't have right access to my work calendar. It only has right access to its own calendar. And again, it really wanted me to give it edit access to my calendar. and I'm sorry, but absolutely not. And so, just like a colleague, just like an EA, instead I said, \"Hey, can you just create an event on your calendar and invite me to it?\" And it thought I was smart and said it would do that. And it did that really well. So, it added separate calendar blocks to my invite and it was really nice. Now, I noticed finally I found that it was actually on my calendar and so I at a different time. So I had it delete the duplicate event and actually um reset it and it got that completely right. So I would say for a single calendar event with a little back and forth it did pretty well. Like this is a little bit of what an assistant would do. My only complaints on this was actually how it thought about doing it was definitely like give me access to everything and I'll just impersonate you and and do things on your behalf. And that's really not what I wanted. I wanted it to act like a assistant. So the next thing that I did was I wanted to figure out what more Claudebot could do for me. And so I asked it directly like, \"Let's figure out how we can work together. I want to stay coordinated on tasks. Tell me how you want to work together.\" And it gave me some really good options and was pretty flexible about how we could work together. And it called out what it already has, which is calendar access, date memory files, Telegram where we can communicate, Gmail access, which we just talked about. And here are some options. We could do a to-do file, we could use calendar events, we could use email, we could keep notes. What's my preference? And I just said, again, I don't really care how we work with my my AI bot. I just said, whatever is easier for you. And then I dumped a bunch of things that are top of mind. Again, this is how I would work with an EA. I just sit down with them, text them, slack them and say, \"Hey, this was on my mind. Can you get it all organized and work me through it?\" So, what was on my mind? I have an interview with the CEO of Versel. I need to reschedule some of our upcoming How I AI episodes because, if you all don't know, I'm coming back for maternity leave and I over booked myself. I have to stay on top of my enterprise pipeline for chat PRD. So, I want it to focus on my CRM. And those are the top priorities I have. and it summarized those priorities back to me, captured them in a to-do, and then started on the first task, which was rescheduling my how I AI recordings and making some recommendations on how I can do my calendar events better. Now, one thing I want to call out while we're sitting here, um, is this all looks really, really great and super fun. Like, yep, got it. Here are your priorities. The reality is one thing that I don't hear people talking about in terms of Claudebot is latency. It is actually real slow. And it's not slow compared to a human necessarily, right? Like if you text a human or Slack and EA and you say, \"Hey, here are my priorities.\" It's going to take them a hot minute to kind of organize them, get the work done, and um and get back to you. But when you're used to something like clawed code, like a cursor, like a chat GPT, which is always giving you product kind of progress feedback, it's telling you its reasoning. It's showing you its tool calls. It's really hard to wait for an asynchronous bot to get back to you on Telegram. I would say that was one of the pieces that has been most frustrating with working with Cloudbot is it just feels slow. And I know it's because it's spinning off these sub agents. It's doing a lot of tasks. It's probably prompted only to get back to you when it has something to do or needs clarification, but it's quite slow. And you'll actually see in the prompting I ask it, can you always send me an ACT message when I send something even if you need to research or kick off a sub agent? Now, it did not do this, so it still remained slow, but I have to figure out how to get it to always respond to me first versus setting off its task. Okay, so back to the task that we were doing at hand. I asked it to give me um some recommendations on how I AI podcast rescheduled. I had like five in the first week. I'm back from Matt leave that is cuckoo. And so what it recommended is that I keep a couple um episodes. I rescheduled some after Valentine's Day. It asked me my thoughts. I gave it some feedback and it revised its plan. Now, here's where things get fun. Once we aligned on what I wanted to move to later, I asked it to email those two people that I needed to reschedule and asked them if they would mind rescheduling to March. I gave that it's my scheduling link so they could actually just self-reschedule to mark and I said copy my work email on those emails and it said drafting those emails down now I thought it would draft them. I was I was wrong. It just sent them and it sent them in a very funny way. Okay. So then it sent this email which was lovely. It said, \"I hope you do well. I wanted to talk to you about our podcast recording. I need to reschedule. Except it sent it as me. It sent it as Clarvo and it's clearly coming from a separate email address. I gave it a fake name. It was [laughter] not good at all and it actually impersonated me. So, I actually responded to this lovely podcast guest and I said, \"I'm sorry. I'm testing Claudebot. It totally impersonated me and made me sound crazy. Uh, but please can we can we still reschedule?\" So, thank you to my two guests for being really patient as my AI guinea pigs. And I went back to Claudebot and I said, \"Come on, man. Don't impersonate me. You need to reach out as my assistant. I already explained this. I already gave you an identity. Like, please always identify yourself as an assistant.\" And it should, I think, knock on wood, store this in its memory and do this in the future. But it was a really funny learning in terms of prompting is really quite important. I thought I was being fairly careful with permissions, which I was. It could only do a couple things, but I underestimated how much it seems like this tool is biased towards acting as you as opposed to acting as an assistant. And I'll have to look through the repository and I'll have to kind of get myself familiar with how it's implemented. That's not the intention of this podcast to really understand why that is happening. But prompting really, really matters. And I think the product lesson here that's kind of interesting is yes, I could have been really, really precious about prompting. I could have said, \"Create a draft of this email to these guests. Send it to me for review before you send it.\" But at the point that I'm doing that and each turn takes at least a couple minutes, this is not a productivity tool. this is not making me more efficient than sending that email myself. And so I do think there's this balance between these autonomous agents being user controlled and being really cautious about how you prompt it and being autonomous and probably doing some things wrong. And I think this is a prompting problem on both sides. It's a prompting problem on the product provider side. It's a prompting problem on the user side. And I don't think enough people are probably sophisticated enough to decompose why one prompt versus the other would do well if you're just a consumer or a proumer. And so I think this is where a lot of the weird behaviors that you'll see are coming out. So so far what have I done with Claudebot? I've installed it. I have given an identity. We have rescheduled one event or we have scheduled one event. We have given an access to email. We have rescheduled two events now and emailed guest about these events. And then this is where it goes crazy. This is where it gets fun. So I decided to give it edit access to our family calendar. This is a calendar where we have pickups and drop offs and basketball games and piano practice and my ballet practice and all that stuff. Now I love this calendar. It was very important to me and if I needed to nuke it, I definitely could. So I gave it access and what I wanted it to do was one email my husband and I about upcoming week and you know get us coordinated on where there were gaps in terms of pickups or conflicts where I was across the city at a Verscell event and he was needing to pick up the kids for basketball practice and I wanted it to fill out the rest of my calendar. My kids have started a new basketball season. Our neighbors picking up the kids on a certain day. all those things I wanted to get it done. And here [snorts] is the problem. I gave it a bunch of instructions and it could read that calendar pretty well. It could categorize the events pretty well and it had no idea what day it was. And so as I was on Telegram going back and forth giving it, can you add this? Can you remove this? Can you change the schedule? I thought it was doing a great job on Telegram because I wasn't really paying super attention. Um, and it was confirming that it did all these things and then I opened up my calendar and everything was on the wrong day. I mean, everything was on the wrong day. And if you are a parent, you get this. You're like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is so and so picking up kid number two on Tuesdays or Wednesdays? And I know I moved piano, but I don't think I moved it to that day.\" So, it took me a second to understand the damage it had it had done, but it had really gotten things wrong. You can see me say, \"Stop. You are setting all these one day late.\" And it was setting everything one day late. And not only was it setting everything one day late, the CLI tool that it was using to add these events to the calendar could only set oneoff calendars. And so, every it could not set a recurring event. So, if I wanted to delete these broken events, I had to go through one by one and delete them. And then the other problem with our crustation friend here when you're collaborating with them is I was on my computer, this one, um, with my calendar open. It was over here in the CLI with its CLI open, and we were conflicting with each other. So I would try to delete all these bad events and then it would go put them back cuz it thought something got broken. We were just I was trying to add them in. I said, you know, stop. It did not stop because of latency and because of these sub agents. And so I went through and set up everything correctly and it went through and deleted all my work. It was it was terrible. It was really really stressful. Um and I said, you know, I had to completely redo. It's like emailing my husband every five seconds. Um, and so it it was not great and it actually never got it right. And I will show and share with you the discussion we had about time zones. But this is another thing that you know non-software engineers using something like this really have to be aware of is as I said on X the only remaining software engineering problem is time zone conversion and LLMs just have no sense of space and time. It just does not know when now is. It doesn't have a sense of time passing. Um now I will say Claudebot because it has these daily files and daily logs has a little bit more of a temporal sense but not a great one. And so if you don't understand why a computer could get dates wrong using a tool like this, you're going to get really frustrated. I could at least understand why time zone conversion, maybe there was a UTC time stamp in the Google API. I could at least understand why this was happening and help guide it towards a solution. But it certainly was frustrating and something that I don't think your everyday user would be able to do. So, I'm going to entertain you all and I'm I'm going to tell you as I was doing this, um, I took a pause and I took my two youngest kids to Target because we were out of stuff. So, I asked if it could discuss things with me via voice and it said, \"Sure, you can send me voice notes. I can send text back. I could send you voice notes back or we could go through Twilio and I could set up a phone call.\" I just said, \"Let's set up voice notes to your text reply.\" And so I could um press voice on Telegram and have it reply to me as I was on the go. And so while we were in this back and forth on um time zones, I want to share with you my delightful voice messages to Claudebot because this was a real real energy. Let's see if we can hear them. Okay, so this is me at Target pushing a cart getting really mad at Claudebot. You put it back, but that is a third a Friday. Friday is correct date, so do not change anything, but can you please explain to me why you are getting days mixed up? This league game is on the correct day. Again, please do not change it, but I do not understand why you have the days mixed up. Okay, so I am getting super annoyed by this um experience of getting days wrong. And it replies, \"Oh my gosh, you are absolutely right. I see the problem now. I was off by one day. Here's all the new dates.\" And they were still definitely off by one day. So once I sent my mean mom message, it came back with me and said, \"You are absolutely right. I apologize. Here are the dates.\" Right. The issue is I've been, this is fiery funny, I've been trying to quote unquote mentally calculate which day of the week each date falls on. Even though the API is telling me what the date of week is, I should probably trust it. But I was using my LLM brain to decide. And what did I say back to it? Well, I said this. You are a computer. You are not doing anything quote unquote mentally. You are making calculations. Can you look in your logs at all and understand where the calculations come from or no? And if you did not enjoy this, that is my very, very new baby crying in the background as I'm lifting him from the car seat into the stroller. It was quite an energy. And again, this is one of those things that as a software engineer, I get it. I have done time zone conversions for my for for my whole life. I understand the APIs return things in all sorts of formats. I understand LLMs can't do, you know, basic math when it comes to dates. It's just too hard. We do not have the technology. And yet, the fact that this model told me it was doing it in his head was so hilarious. So, once we had the back and forth about this, it gave itself a rule to follow in terms of getting these dates right, and then I asked it to add it to its rules. Now, the final thing that we did is I asked if it could send me voice notes back. And this is where some of the magic of Clawbot really does come out. One of the things that people have been saying about Claudebot that's so cool is you can just get it can give it self skills. It can learn things. It can just do things very magically. And if you were trying to get back and forth voice notes in Telegram, it would have been pretty hard to like figure out what API you want to use and what skill and hook it up and use cloud code, all this stuff. And it just did it. So, when I said, \"Can you please send me voice notes back?\" It just sent me a voice note back. So, let's see. >> Yes, I can send voice messages back to you. Let me know if you'd like me to use voice for replies. I can do that anytime you want. >> So, that was a pretty magical moment. And, you know, I've been giving Claudebot a really hard time in in this episode. Not because I don't think it's an awesome product. The reality is going back and forth via text with something that has helpful access to your calendar, has helpful access to your email, can learn skills like voice that you can just chitchat to. I actually really liked the form factor of the experience and I liked the concept of what it could deliver. It was just that the implementation of it had a couple things. one, too technical for the everyday user, two, too scary to the security aware user, and three, latency that took some of the magic away from the experience. And so again, I don't think this is a bad product from a capital P product perspective. I'm just not in love with the implementation. And we'll just summarize my what I did with Claudebot with my last use case, which is I had Claudebot use its history to create a Nex.js app that showed the history of our conversation. And I asked it to redact names, numbers, URLs, email addresses, all that stuff so I could share it with all of you. Um, so again, kind of a classic AI engineering AI coding vibe coding use case. Now, the one thing that I will say is a lot of people are really excited or say they're excited, I don't know if they've used it, to use Cloudbot to spin off Cloud Code to do coding for them. And where this wasn't the magic use case for me and why I didn't start it is I've been spinning off remote agents with computer access to do coding for me for a while. I use Devon which has a virtual machine in a local environment and can spin up stuff access to the web uh all the time. I use it from Slack so I can appmention Devon. You know I have a Slackbot for chat pd so I'm apping my product manager all the time. Cursor has background agents. You know everything has you you codeex you can kick off online. So I don't know if people are just not using those tools. I guess claude code um doesn't have have one like that quite yet. I don't know if people aren't using those tools, but I've been coding by kicking off an asynchronous teammate, quote unquote, for, you know, two years now. And so that piece was never what I wanted to use Claudebot for. But I thought, you got to vi code something when you're trying a new agent. And I did that. So what I did is I sent Polly the Claudebot a voice note. And this is the requirements I gave it. Okay, let's use voice from here on out. I want you to document our conversation in a next.js JS web app that shows the back and forth of our full conversation from the very beginning today till the end in a UI. I want you to redact anything that is a secret key, a person's name or a specific place. And I want to toggle between two UI versions of this display. I want you to be able to show me a terminal style conversation back and forth similar to a claude code or you claude bot c l a w db b o t or I want you to show me a telegram style text back and forth. The content should be in JSON the same again redact names, emails, dates, etc. replace them with placeholders or redacted blocks and then generate the next JS app. I'm going to use this so I can share this conversation with others without sharing my information or having to do a screen recording. We are eventually going to deploy this to Verscell. Can you let me know when it's deployed to Versel so I can look at it? So I sent it this message and it kicked off local development building a next.js app. Now, when I got back to my laptop that Claude was running on, one of the things that I noticed is deploying it actually wasn't that simple. Claudebot didn't have a GitHub account. Claudebot I didn't really want to add to my Versell account. I didn't want to log into those things. It seemed like a big rigomearroll. And so, getting it to deploy without having to set up a bunch of accounts seemed not fun. So what I did instead, don't tell anybody, is I air dropped the repo to my own laptop here. I actually logged into Claude Code and made some edits. And to be honest, in terms of coding quality and just the back and forth with the latency of Claudebot and the inability to sort of see what decisions it's making from a coding perspective, I didn't love Claudebot Telegram vibe coding. It's just too slow. the cycles aren't good enough, they aren't incremental enough, it's clearly not like perfectly tuned for the coding use case. It's not like sending me a PR link, all those sorts of things. And so I just preferred working with it on my desktop in claw code and deploying it through my normal system. So that's a little bit feedback there. One thing that I did think was really cool is when I was on my go on the go and it said the app was ready, you know, I was in Target or whatever and I wasn't at a place where I could run a local machine. It was pretty cool to say, hey, like shoot me a screenshot of what it looks like and it did it shot me screenshots of what the app looked like directly in Telegram. So, I do think there's some underappreciated aspects, really simple things. Email me that file, share me a screenshot that are really useful to interface with a a laptop or a desktop or a device at home. So, I do think this is an underappreciated aspect of being able to chat with your computer. It can do things like send you files, take screenshots, open up browsers. That is pretty cool, especially since we don't store everything in the cloud. All my desktop screenshots are not in the cloud. some of the PDFs that I download are not in the cloud. And so this is this was a really kind of like fun use case for chatting with a remote developer. Now, that being said, Devon sends me screenshots all the time. I don't think it's perfect for coding, but it's something to think about. So, I want to end this workflow section with one workflow that I thought it did a particularly good job at. And it was good for two reasons. One, the product interface was what I wanted. I got the full Claudebot bot experience. The second thing was the output was really good. So what did I ask it to do? Well, I asked Claudebot to go on Reddit and research what people would want from Chat PD. So I said go on Reddit. I I did this during voice note. I said go on Reddit, find what people want from Chat PR, find what they want from a product AI platform and email me a report. And what did I love about the product experience? One of the killer features of Cladbot is the ability to message anywhere, anything, anyhow. I sent it to voice note. I could shoot it an email. I could text if that was faster. And it would reply in kind as text, as voice, whatever. And it would also email me. So, it felt very much like an employee that I was working with. Hey, like send them a Slack. And they're like, yep, it's in your inbox. That sort of always on anywhere anyhow communication flow for the agent was really really nice. The second thing I like from a product perspective is I've talked about this from a negative point of view which is the latency is not great. It's just not super responsive and super fast and it's kind of broken sometimes. But if this is a research task that I don't really think should come back quickly, I don't mind waiting for Claudebot to do a good job. And it did. And it's very similar to an experience with an employee. if I give them sort of a research task or roadmap task, I don't expect it to be returned in 30 seconds except they go out, do a bunch of research and come back to me and so I wasn't as bothered by the latency here. And then the third thing is I thought the output was actually quite good. So, I'll show you what it sent me, which is it sent me this chat Reddit research markdown document, emailed it to my inbox, and it listed out key insights from research Reddit from researching Reddit. And what I thought was awesome is this is right, but it's presented in a really simple, punchy way that I can go action. this is exactly how I would want a PM or a research assistant on my team to come back with insights and these are the things that we hear. So, it was really accurate. You know, integration limitations both on our side and customer sites hard. No one reads long PRDs. Let's make our PRDS shorter. Um, you know, PRDs need to be living documents. All these things, a couple bullet points, a couple reference links to Reddit threads. And I have a full document that I can go build a road map off of. And in fact, that's exactly what I asked it to do. I said, go build a road map based on this. look at our current functionality and tell me what I should build next. This felt pretty magic. I'm probably going to steal some of these ideas. I'm going to circle around to that in a little bit in terms of what I think is next for Claudebot. But I do think there is going to be demand both from a consumer perspective and from an enterprise business perspective on a agent employee that feels like an agent employee. It has a computer. It has account access. It can do things. It does those things well. But I think there are some things we're going to have to figure out first before we let it loose. And again, you can see this here. I asked it to do a road map. It totally just didn't do it. It forgot it. Said, \"Let me check on the background agent.\" Then never replied. So again, we're hitting some, you know, sharp edges on the product experience. It's not perfect, but it is pretty interesting. So what have I showed you so far? One, I have told you a little bit at a high level what Claudebot is. Although I haven't gone into all the detail about how it works, not really the point of this episode. I've showed how to onboard with Claudebot, including how to connect Telegram to chat back and forth with it on text or voice. I've showed you how I give access to its own Gmail workspace account as well as one password so it can interact with limited scope to my data. I've given you some warnings about what you should think about in terms of scope and access there. I've gone through a couple workflows, couple admin workflows, which are simple calendar all the way to advanced calendar management. Did not do well because it doesn't have a good sense of time and space, but hopefully we'll figure that out. As software engineers overall, I asked it to contact partners and guests by email. It did not a great job there because it lost a sense of its own identity. I had it do vibe coding, which it did a fine job at, but is definitely not my favorite tool for AI engineering remotely and asynchronously. And then finally, I showed you my favorite use case was for it to do some complex research and analysis with tools with web. And it did a really good job and came back with came back to me with something that I really like. Now, one thing that I didn't go check that I'm going to go check next is did it teach itself all these skills? Was it really telling me the truth when it said it had rules? A peak under the hood, which I will probably do as a follow-up either on X or here on the podcast. Like, how does this thing work behind the scenes? That was not the point of this episode. The point of this episode was to show how somebody would come with a blank idea, maybe a fresh Mac Mini, install this thing from the command line, and actually get it to do things. And I think I showed you it's good at some things, bad at others, and scary across the board. So, let's get to my final thoughts here, which are basically that and and I shared this on X. But the whole time I was doing Claudebot, the whole time I was using this, I thought two things. One, this is so scary. This is a terrible idea. Nobody should be doing this. It should not have access to all this stuff on my computer. I should not be sharing these keys locally. I should not let LLMs have access to Gmail OOTH, even if it's a sandbox app. I was like, \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. SOS. Don't love it.\" As I said, this is the final boss of security training. You should be very careful about what you give it access to. And one of the things that I'm most concerned about is probably you get the most power from Claudebot if you give it access to your actual inbox, to your actual calendar, to your actual documents, to your actual repositories, your actual GitHub. And I can imagine so many things going wrong with that. Just knowing how it's built, which it's built in an awesome way. I think Pete's done an incredible job. I don't think there's any ill will or mal intent in how it's built. It's powerful. It self-learns. It installs skills. It asks for permission. It's pretty independent. All that stuff is great until you have full readr access to your most personal information. And one of the things that I was thinking as I was, you know, preparing for the show is great, I just gave an autonomous AI agent access to where my kids basketball practices are. Like is that something like do we want to selfdoc um AI crustation? Probably not. So I think that's going to be one of the challenges of this product because the second feeling I had was boy oh boy, I want this thing. I want AI that I can text. I want AI that does not make it complicated to talk back and forth with voice. I want AI that when I say, \"Hey, can you look at my CRM?\" doesn't say, \"Go to this web page and press this button and enter this API key and do this and that.\" I just want it to happen automatically. I want all that. I just don't think this is it yet. Like this does not feel yet like the interface to get me there. And so I have this real tension between I think the product from product experience isn't quite there yet. It's not really for the non-technical. So it really is for tinkerers and hackers. There's a lot of security stuff here that's super scary. And can I have it please? And so maybe this is an example of something that from a market category perspective definitely has product market fit. There are gajillions of dollars to make here. I just don't know if this open- source YOLO mode terminal tool is is the thing. And in fact, I'm gonna take, you know, this laptop soon and office space it. Um, for those of you that are very young, that means I'm going to go like hit it with sledgehammer. But like, I'm going to uninstall it. I'm going to remove those keys. I'm going to delete the Telegram B. Like, I don't like this. This makes me nervous. And I'm also going to go build one for myself. And so I think there is why there has been such a zeitgeist around this product is it is actually really cool to be able to chat voice whatever a very smart self-sufficient agent and hackers see it and they're also you know more risk tolerance than the everyday person. But that being said, like husband, please don't connect your Gmail to this. Like mom, absolutely not. Like kids, stay away. Not not safe for kids. Like this is just this is something that unless you have been through a security tabletop exercise and know what to know. Um I would just be really cautious about how permissive you are in terms of access. And that leads me to my final final question of this episode, which is, you know, I think Claude will live in our hearts forever. And in fact, it's probably got a great feature in front of it. I love how fast the team is going, Claudebot. But who's going to build this thing for real? Like, who is actually going to build this thing for real? Who is going to build the consumer version of it? Who is going to build the enterprise version of it? Who is going to get it right? And I think this is a complicated question, and I'm just going to pose some thoughts as we close out this episode. You know, this should be Google or Microsoft's game to lose. Maybe even Metas on the consumer side, but this should be Google or Microsoft's game to lose. Like, they have the data, they have your Gmail, they have your calendar, they have documents, they have the models. The models are exceptional. They just got to build the, you know, they have devices. um Android, they just have to build the product experience and have the sort of institutional fortitude and um close your eyes legal team to allow some of this to happen because I think it's a really cool product built on top of the Google ecosystem. I mean, I think the same on the enterprise from a Microsoft perspective. If Copilot did this, this is pretty incredible. That being said, I don't know if those companies are going to have the velocity or the bravery to go as yolo as Cloudbot did. So, I don't know if we're going to get there with the big companies. On the flip side, you see Cloudbot open source, great for hackers, but super scary. Um, giving like API key and OOTH access. Smaller companies, startups are going to see this and want to build this. And I think one of the things that I would warn startups, it's really hard to build on top of these data sources for real because Google doesn't want to give you read, write, go, do everything access to their data. Microsoft does not. You have to go through these compliance hoops and approvals and um reviews. And so while I love the idea of a do everything, do anything bot, it's going to be complicated from a product builder perspective. It's going to be complicated from a large company perspective. who gets the data and then again like is Apple gonna get in this game? This is just what everybody wants from Siri to do. Siri has all your apps, all your access but again it's a combination of product building skills and um risk tolerance I think and willingness to experiment. Maybe anthropic and open AI come in. Maybe we get our open AI OS and workspace tools and maybe we get cla um we get some new versions of this. It'll just be really interesting to see how this shakes out. So, in conclusion, what are my thoughts about Clawbot? It is scary. It is fun. Um, it does some things really, really well. It is really interesting from a interface perspective and it doesn't always work. And I'm not sure it's for I was going to say everyone, but I'm not sure it's for for anyone right now except for people who are really willing to roll the dice with their AI bot. That being said, if you're willing to do that, the way this has been built, the way it self-discover skills, the way it stores its memory, the way it gives itself access is really interesting and should inspire a lot of product builders thinking about AI products on what the interface of the future is. I think we are going to be seeing and hearing a lot more about agents like this. I am going to be giving you my honest takes about where they are now and where they're going to be in the future. And in the meantime, I'm going to go execute Polly the Clawbot. Thanks, and I'll see you next time on How I AI. Thanks so much for watching.

    "transcript": "There are people out there definitely like me that really want to know the advanced techniques that can leverage the most powerful parts of these AI powered coding tools. Where do you want us to get started that you think many people don't think [music] about in terms of how they can use these tools? >> Context and diagrams is a great place to start. They're definitely the best way to get AI to do what you want. So, they have what are called mermaid diagrams. This is a way of visualizing database operations and it's a way of essentially compressing your application down into very small lines of text that show how your application works. Now for a human to read this, this is a big challenge. But an AI can consume this easily. I could even just say, \"Please explain the authentication flow.\" And because it already has it in the context, it's not going to have to do a bunch of file reads [music] and codebase exploration to figure this out. It's going to come up with results much quicker. >> If I gave you infinite junior to mid-career talent who [music] is always available, who would do the work you would do if you had unlimited amount of time and no meetings? What would you do when a ticket came in? Like what would you do? [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vio, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have John Linquist at egghead.io who is a super user of AI powered engineering tools like cursor [music] and claude code. Now, I love all you nontechnical folks out there, but this is an episode for the senior software engineers who really want to understand how they can use the power features of some of these AI engineering tools to really both optimize the quality of code that they're generating, but also become more efficient as they use their IDE, terminal, and AI assistance to write, check, and deploy code. This is a great episode for any of our advanced users out there. VPs of engineering, CTO, pay attention. Send this to your staff, engineers. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. [music] AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets automatically. [music] But there's a catch. These tools only work well when they have deep access to company systems. [music] Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across [music] internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that raises serious security concerns. That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, access [music] controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise features. Building all that from scratch, [music] it's a massive lift. That's where Work OS comes in. Work OS gives you [music] drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale [music] up market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, [music] and Cursor are already using work OS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at works.com. Start building today. John, welcome to How I AI. I have to put some context here which is we have done quite a bit of coding with cursor vibe coding episodes but a lot of what our audience has asked for is early maturity less technical introductions to these tools. But there are people out there definitely like me um and definitely like folks that follow you that really do know how to write great software and want to you know as people say of course I'm a 9x engineer but how do I become a 10x engineer with some of these tools want to know really the advanced techniques that can leverage the most powerful parts of these AI powered coding tools and get you really high quality software. So I'm really excited about what you're going to show us today. And so where do you want us to get started that you think many people don't think about in terms of how they can use these tools? >> Yeah, I think uh context and diagrams is a great place to start for us. Um they're definitely the best way to get AI to do what you want. So um and we'll be using cloud code throughout. >> Oh, great. Okay. And so yeah, we've we've gotten a lot of kind of markdown files in How AI, but not a lot of diagrams. So why don't you walk us through >> how you use those those assets to help you code better. >> Yeah. So these diagrams are all generated from I can share a prompt with however you want to share with the audience um that can walk through your codebase and generate diagrams based on uh user actions or user interactions the events the channels whatever happens in your code to help the AI understand the flow and how the pieces are connected. Um I think Windinsurf recently came out with something called code maps, a similar concept. Um essentially preloading valuable context so that you have to remember that every time an AI starts it has no memory, no idea of what's going on in your application and people try and set up lots of rules and all the stuff around it. Um, but they usually don't include a lot of how does my application work and how do the pieces fit and so you get a lot of really bad edits because it doesn't understand if it if it modifies A, how does that impact B? Um, so we want to preload a lot of that. We can do that using diagrams. Uh, so for example, one of these diagrams um will have I I call they're markdown files with diagrams in them. So they have what are called mermaid diagrams and mermaid is a standard format for rendering diagrams inside of markdown. So this is a a way of visualizing uh database operations. And if you to zoom zoom in and look at uh how if a record exists then do this and that. Yes. No. And it's a a way of essentially compressing your application down into very small lines of text that show how your application works. Now for a human to read this, this is a big challenge. Uh we need to open up this big visual and it turns into like looks like an image. But an AI can consume this easily and it's like a very compressed very um robust way of explaining application. So we can feed these into our application at at the startup time. Um, and for the more advanced pro or the larger projects you get on, the more diagrams you'll have, and you can kind of pick and choose which ones to load. Um, I'm going to load them all in. And I'm just going to open um terminal up the editor area. So, the way I'm going to do this, if we look at Claude and we look at look at its options, um, you'll see a bunch of options. The one we're going to focus on is called append system prompt. So in there before we load in uh any sort of user prompt or anything we're actually going to say claude append system prompt system prompt and then you can drop in some text and we're going to drop in a command and this command can read in from our memory from AI/diagrams and then this is going to read through this is a called a glob pattern read through all of the markdown files essentially force them into claude once I do this. So this is reading all the files all the markdown files and this is cat will kind of concatenate them all together into a single uh text read. >> Yeah. One thing I want to call out for folks that are watching this that or or are listening and maybe not watching is two things. It seems like, you know, in your in your standard repos, you're creating a a memory um directory where you're going to structure some of the context and files you might want any of these AI tools to use. And I think everybody's like, \"Oh yeah, I've created my agents markdown file or my clawed one.\" And I think you can actually structure your um context for these tools a lot more purposefully. And so I think this is a really good example of this. The other thing that I I think a lot of people are quite lazy about is they haven't explored the surface area of all the system commands available in cloud code. And so by using that help command, you can actually see things that not just chatting with clot code you can do, but you can actually inject into how claude operates. And appending system prompt is one of those ones that I think people probably underuse. >> Yeah, absolutely. Um, it's one I use constantly. Um, great points there. Um, so when when I let this run, you'll notice that there's um it's now prompting the user to do something. And we don't have to try and reference all of the files, which you normally do with AT. We don't have to try and tell it, you know, what we're going to work on. I could even just say, like, I use dictation all the time. Uh, please explain the authentication flow. And because it already has it in the context, it's not going to have to do a bunch of file reads and codebase exploration to figure this out. It's going to come up with results much quicker. This this does come at the cost of a lot more context, a lot more um tokens being used up front, but the work that you do, the time that you spend on these tasks is more valuable than that to me. So, you'll notice that there were no file reads in this. There were no um it did not search the codebase. It didn't do any of that stuff. It just simply had all that in context. And now I could take this and look through it, start creating plans, swap over to plan mode to how we want to uh update and um change authentication. So this saves again the the the trade-off here is the cost of many tokens up front but the value is you get a lot faster and a lot more valuable output as the tasks complete much faster the tasks are much more reliable because it understands what's going on in the codebase. >> Two things I think people should think about with this flow. one is I've said this in a couple episodes and and we'll call it out again in yours is I think that with LLM starting to become more of a part of how we do work and feed context and understand things like documentation or business context. This is the era of the the file type and I think so many people think about markdown and JSON files as effective ways to inject context into LLMs. I see a lot of course markdown files. I think more people now write markdown than they h than they have in many many years. And then a lot of we've had some episodes on using JSON for example to put realistic or semi-realistic data into prototypes. But we are having more and more episodes where people are discovering specific file types that have a specific context structure that are really useful for a use case. In this one, you have mermaid diagrams, which again are hard to parse as a human. And even if they turn into graphics, are still hard to parse as a human. Like I looked at that big diagram of my eyes crossed and I said, I don't I don't want to read this. But to a machine, it's very effective. We've also in some episodes talked about um image and multimedia file formats that not only contain image data, but contain metadata that you can use. And so I think this is an interesting moment where we can all use different file types in a more extensive way than our kind of human brains could because the machines are so good at using the different component structures or syntax of of those files. So I think that's pretty interesting and I think mermaid diagrams are one of those examples um of something that can be used really well. >> Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot of research being done into how they can compress all of this information down into like a single image. So, if I could take all of the diagram files and somehow come up with an image format that would store everything in there, could would the trade-off on tokens be there and would the trade-off on understanding be there as well? Um it's uh we we'll see if there's more file types that emerge and I'm huge um on video and using videos uh Gemini being the best model for uploading video and understanding um and recently built a tool that can take one of my six-hour workshops and uh process the entire thing and take out notes and examples and thoughts and frequently asked questions. And so each time I teach a workshop, I can iterate on it and um I don't have to go like search through the video some other way. It's >> you and I will have to trade notes because I did a very similar thing with our episodes which is it takes a video of our episode. It pulls out all the learnings, all the code snippets, screenshots where the guest and I look cute and put it into into a blog post. So So I agree on that. You know, the second question I had for you though is going back to these diagram files in this memory directory. Where in your development process do you find that you generate those files? So for me, I actually have a GitHub action that generates files almost exactly like you have with documentation and diagrams for new features um of a of a specific scope. And so I do it when a pull request is closed and then I go back and um update update our diagrams. I'm I'm curious where this falls in your where documentation like this falls into your workflow. >> Yeah, usually I think pull request is a a good paradigm there. Uh as soon as you have something working where you want it to be working and then you can say okay now this is working as expected. Please diagram it. I think for a lot of the projects, we already have pre-existing um code bases that don't have diagrams. And so that's that's been the major use case is taking existing stuff and um diagramming all of that so that our AI development is accelerated, I guess, is the buzzword. Um but yeah, if you're starting from scratch, you definitely just want to spike spike things out, get it working. Um don't worry about diagrams up front. um just use a plan mode, build something and once it's working, then diagram it out. And then even with the diagrams, um they're great to help walk you through like what did I just build? Like I didn't look any of this code. Uh show me diagrams of what the code is doing. And then if the diagrams look kind of wonky, you can just say there there's there's tools in there that people are working on where you can like drag around pieces of the diagram to say, well, I don't want this to navigate there. I don't want this user do that. We could I don't there's going to be so many tools in the next few years that emerge from all this. >> Yeah. And then I will give folks just a couple other use cases of generating mermaid diagrams from code that are not just about improving the efficiency of using something like cloud code. Um I use a lot of diagram generating out of our repo to answer very complex security and data flow requirements from our customers. This is a it's a workflow that is actually like pretty expensive if you ask an engineer to do it which is I have specific customer A they need a very specific data flow diagram of this part of our application so they can understand the third party parts of it again also if you're going through sock 2 compliance or any compliance like these are these are assets that historically have just been so tedious to create efficiently and effectively and now you can kind of generate them on demand. My last question for you on this diagram flow is do you find that you have the AI write or you would write documentation any differently than you would for a human audience or do you feel like there's enough overlap that the content format etc can be pretty consistent between the two? >> I would say could be pretty consistent. I I think they serve as a nice bridge between kind of human and AI. Um definitely think I I know people generate documents like you'll write code and then generate documentation around it using AI for both steps which is just wild but um yeah I think the markdown is kind of the language of the future for a lot of this um text and then there you can do images and everything inside of markdown files as well. So they can kind of and the front matter metadata. Um you'll you see claude using that extensively for their skills and commands. >> Yep. >> And everything. So um and anthropic is pretty good at pioneering all this stuff. So >> if they're using markdown then >> everybody else can. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Uh again for people who want to like pull the thread a little further uh what what I do is yeah we generate a lot of AI code then on poll request we generate AI documentation internally for engineers and for AI obviously to use this context and then we take that code and we generate markdown customerf facing support documents again that really benefit from these workflows because then you say click button A move to section B save this and so you can really pull the thread on docu documentation from one asset and I think you're showing a place where it's really useful from the engineering perspective but it can start to become customerf facing and all sorts of interesting things. >> Yeah. And you could summarize the documents for customers. Um you could have it build little interactive demos. I mean there's the sky's is the limit. Like how however much you want to support customers there is if this is enough then then great. If it's not then it's an AI prompt away from >> something pretty. I guess >> this episode is brought to you by [music] Times, the intelligent workflow platform powering the world's most important work. Business moves faster than the systems meant to support it.

So, you showed us how to just pull all of these documents into a system prompt. You get much more um performant use of something like Claude Code. And this seems like a command that you're using over and over again. And that's something you and I talked about before we started recording, which is how to alias and make more efficient your use of of different commands. So, should we should we pop over to that or anything else you want to show on diagrams? >> That's that's great. Let's do that. Um, so there are a lot of uh with with on Mac it's DSH is the default shell. Um, on Windows I do PowerShell. So, this look very different. Um, but depending on what tools you use the most, you can easily set up aliases for things like setting the default model for for claude or setting like if you want to do something completely dangerously so that once you open a new terminal, if you just type X now, anything I type has bypass permissions enabled. Or if I type H, this will be Haiku. It'll be much faster, but not quite as smart. Um or if I type in the scenario CDI um this will do that diagram loading um where once you have these systems in place these commands in place then you can just uh kind of capture them in the smallest like because I only because I use these a lot I I I keep them in very short shortcuts. Yeah, and I can imagine you could you could do something like this for project specific context to so you could do like CC dash whatever project you're working on. You could pull in the diagrams for just that initiative. So if you're going back over and over again into specific things that need specific context, this would be just a cheap shortcut to to get you into the mode of for example cloud code that you want. >> Yeah, absolutely. >> And you showed a lot of cloud examples here. Are there any other ones that you think are really really useful for folks or creative uses of this you think we should think about? >> So I tend to build any idea I come up with. Um so for example this is one I'm working on called sketch and this feeds into the Gemini uh Gemini CLI. So like what type of website do want to do I want to build? Let's do a store for selling uh Christmas decorations. And then let's make the homepage of that. Let's make it creative and artistic for a desktop website. We'll do the GitHub light theme for it. No reference image. Let's do five images and go ahead and generate it. And this is the sort of thing where um kind of beyond beyond the simple alias if you uh if you've never dived into creating what's called a CLI you can tell an AI like listen I want to use like this is a wrapper around um Gemini where it will execute Gemini with specific prompts. So you have to remember that you have these tools on your desktop which can do incredible things but you can also script them and this is a scripted way of generated generating images based on all of these um all these topics with or these concepts with pre-loaded prompts and I can say if I want to add another feature like you can just go in there and say please tweak the prompts or please add this feature please do this and then instead of um constantly thinking of oh what was that prompt again or was that idea I had. You can have these little CLIs and these little projects that are be just for you. Um because you just like build the tools that you need now. And um this is just spitting out these um my my mom lives with me and she's setting up Christmas decorations upstairs. This is why I'm thinking about this. >> So this >> Yeah, this is Gemini generating based on the prompt we fed in based on the color scheme. This is GitHub light Christmas store color theme. Um, and I told it to generate five variations of it. And then we could take one of these images and drop it into one of the um, drop it into one of the AIS and say, \"Let's start building out this website. Let's break this into sections and go from there.\" And this is kind of like my uh, ideation inspiration sort of thing that that I use. One reason I want to make sure people are paying attention to this use case which is essentially you've exposed a command line interface to do a couple you know script a couple workflows around calling um nanobanana and some of the Gemini models to um >> to to do some things and there are two benefits I think to this that are really important. One is building command line tools has been so opaque and just kind of not fun for so many people for so long. Um I've built lots of them and how easy it is to build a really nice command line tool is such a treat for anybody who's ever had to build them and make them look good. Everybody has these cool ASKY only logos if in their in their command line tools which have been very tedious to make before. So I think one thing is these tools are just a lot easier to build. Two, from a product builder perspective, the reason why I like this move to these command line tools is the constrained UI space of the terminal actually make sure you don't get distracted in building UI around something as simple as this. Right? You just had like five questions you had to answer, a couple multi select. You could tab through those with your keyboard. If you were creating like a little wizzywig walkth through web editor thing here, I mean, one, I would have gotten really distracted about how it looks. Yeah. >> Two, you'd have to type into, you know, you'd have to run localhost and type into um your your your web browser. And so, I actually like the constrained UI space for speed of of prototyping on some of these ideas because you just don't get distracted by anything but the essential kind of toolkit. Um, and then you can get a really cool thing out the other end. >> My only problem is I've built more tools than I can remember and sometimes >> after like where was that thing? Um, >> yeah. I uh I also like what you how you started this this little segment which is you said you just build every idea you have. I think that is totally the move. While you have an idea, kick off something, get it built, build yourself a little throwaway repo. Um, you know, eventually the AI can crawl it and remind you everything that you built before, but this is pretty cool. >> And that's that's why I love dictation because all you have to do is start up a new terminal in a new folder and just kind of brain dump in there and then it'll try something and once you have something even if it's wrong, you can iterate on it. Yeah. >> If you have nothing, you can't iterate on nothing. And I think that's the magic of uh even for people who who hate AI tools. Like a sheet of paper full of things that are wrong is much better than a blank than than nothing because even if it's wrong, you you recognize it's wrong and it helps you think of what's right and what you want to build. >> Yeah, I say this a lot. It's easier to edit than author. So, let's get the authoring out of the way and then even if you completely revise the whole thing, it's a much easier starting sprouting point to work with something. >> Y >> Okay. So, I think we're going to close out and spend uh a little bit of time on your workflow for when you're doing more complex coding projects or features, how you keep those really high quality using some advanced techniques in um I think in cloud code and cursor. So when working on any excuse me when working on any project um often when the AI is generating code it'll often build out mistakes and so even it will say it's done you're like wait a second there were a ton of mistakes there why did you stop just fix it until the mistakes are done so for example um let's say it wrote out this code and there was this error in here and this error is something you'd usually catch with tools such as TypeScript uh or maybe it's formatting or linting or any sort of complexity tools um that they're code quality tools that you run before before you think the work is done. So you would run something like bun type check and you would see that it has this error but your uh claude code and the other agents don't know that this error exists. What Claude has and what cursor cursor and a few others have is the concept of hooks. And what this can do is so inside of claw, let's go here. You can set up what are called hooks. And um [snorts] I'm going to set what's called a stop hook and hit add new hook. And just it shows you a bunch of examples. I'm accepting responsibility for all this. Bunch of warnings because it can run scripts that aren't checked by the AI. And I'm going to say the command for now is just be echo, which does nothing. And I'm going to add it to my project local settings. And now we have this echo hook. And this is defined in this settings local uh.json file. And this is for uh this is a local file for me. If you want it to be with your team, it' be settings.json settings.lojson is distribute. What we're going to do is instead of running this command, we're going to run a custom uh claw claude hook which I've defined inside of claude hooks. Uh and I called it index index.ts. You could call it stop or whatever. So from this script which is in this directory um I need to run this uh install for this package because I don't have it installed right now. So I'm going to bun install and propic and this is their um their clawed agent SDK. Now in the SDK they have um what are called hook inputs and other types you can use so that when you're dealing with hooks you have a lot more information. So like on this input you have all of this information around what the input name is and then what the session ID is and the current working directory permission mode and all that and you can use that to customize your hook. But we're gonna but what we are going to focus on is we're going to see step one were their files changed uh when we stopped. And a stop is once uh Claude has kind of finished its conversation and it's now waiting for you to do something. So we're going to check are there files changed? And we're going to if there's files changed we're going to say okay then let's go ahead and run that bun type check. And if there is a type check then we can say back to claude we can say hey there were typescript errors this is the report and then send them back the output that we showed in the terminal before and it'll continue. Otherwise, if there were files changed, then we can tell Claude to please, there's a prompt way down here. It says, \"Please commit essentially. Uh, get the files, don't commit anything, anything sensitive, and go ahead and commit it.\" So, we set up this workflow of once a conversation is finished, check to see if any files have changed. If they have, you check to see if there's any TypeScript errors, which could be a type check or build errors or any sort of other um code quality uh guards you have in place. And if there are none, then go ahead and commit. And this saves you a lot of the overhead in your mind of uh here's all this extra stuff I have to do once something's done. >> Yeah. And what I want to call out for folks that are maybe listening and not seeing this code here is it's really what's nice about this is it's a combination of commands that you would run in the terminal to to just generate errors and see them yourselves, but then you can feed those back into clawed code in a more natural language way and give natural language instructions on what to fix or again default to some command um that's different which is this GitHub commit command. And so I like this combination of kind of like structured commands in in the terminal combined with natural language calls back into CL claude to then kind of put the bow on the end of any work that this AI system does. Is that kind of how you think about it? >> Yeah, exactly. um that the gotchas you have to think about here are when you're uh when you're communicating from a hook back to Claude, you're essentially using console log, which is one of the first things any JavaScript developer learns and you're sending back a JSON object. So, it's going to find that first console log and whatever gets back, uh that's what it's going to see as its uh as its input, its standard input. So you have to be careful if you're running commands like this. You you tell this one, please be quiet because if it's not quiet, then it would log back to the console and maybe interfere with something. Or if you want other logs or you're debugging the script, just use console error or any other way of showing logs. Um otherwise, console log turn it turns into this feeding instructions back to the agent. So, it's one of those gotchas that everyone falls into when when building this out. Uh, and just to just to demo it real quick, um, I'll just turn on Claude and I'll say um well, actually for this to work correctly, let's make sure we have everything staged and set up so that when it does the get check, um, let's just generate a message. So yeah, let's uh please create a fu.ts file on the root of the project. And we'll go ahead and accept this. And you'll see that it says stop hook returned a blocking error. And that error returns, please fix the TypeScript errors. And here's our prompt right here with this block. And it says I I'll fix a TypeScript error. So this is when it would have stopped. It would have stopped right here. But we hit the stop hook. Now it sees these errors. So it's going to go ahead and read that and says, \"Oh, I found the mismatch quote. I fixed it.\" And now behind the scenes there's a cloud running which should it commit that fix. You make this a bit smaller. Show our graph here. And you'll see um this is the fix that it made was correct the quote syntax. This is what the little ha coup did in the background. So the stop hook ran twice. It ran once where it found the error and had files changed. And then the second time there were no more errors and so it ran the commit. And so that saved us all of that work of both passes. And now we have a completed task that has been error checked, fixed, and then commit um and conditionally enscripted in a way where this will be different for every single project based on your requirements, based on your codebase. Um, so this is definitely something that you have to like think through and set up yourself. It definitely saves so much time where you don't have to go back in and say, \"Well, please fix this or please run this command or please do this.\" When you know part of your workflow is always the like if these things should always run, you might as well run them automatically. >> And something I have to say is I get so much push back from software engineers saying these tools don't really make me faster. The quality isn't as good. And I think if you make the investment as you've shown us in, okay, well, what things would it do to make the quality better or what things would it do that you can automate that would make you a little bit faster? And you put that effort in to understanding all the things that these um tools can do for you either programmatically or through prompting. I think you can actually see a lot of those efficiencies. And then I want to call out something that that you said which is you have this local settings but you can create settings that are shared across your team for anybody that's working in the repo and that's for our engineering leaders out there or larger engineering teams to really think about if you haven't created these hooks for key repos or key projects where everybody is benefiting from this when they're using something like clawed code then you're missing out on some of the scaled leverage I think of of these tools. And so I'd love to put somebody in charge in an engineering organization of figuring how stuff like this can work inside your codebase and then scaling it out either through training or through configuration into all the other engineers so that everybody's getting this baseline quality and this baseline efficiency. >> Yeah. >> Amazing. Well, okay. Other than you know type T type script errors, just pratt off a couple other use cases. You deleted a bunch of stuff from this hook. So, what are the things you think that people should bake into a stop hook like this for cloud code? >> Uh, definitely formatting. Um, I there's there's kind of the the mindset we've always had before of like pre-commit hooks or pre- push hooks, things that operate on the CI and these are a lot of things that can be um fixed before those are even run. So whether it's there's a lot of tools around um with linting it it could constrain the length of files um there's things like uh circular dependencies where I could check the imports to make sure that files don't reference each other um there's code complexity there's tools that say does this code look like any other code in the codebase where um this could be extracted into a function or something because there's like duplicate code throughout the codebase There's all sorts of analytics and tools you could run. Um some of them probably not as often as others because it's more expensive and you just have to make those um decisions based on you know the size of your team, the size of your application. But there's just just put into an AI prompt of chat GBT or any of them to say what are all make a long list of uh developer tools people run on pre- push or uh on pre-commit and you'll see the a huge list of them that you could uh pick and choose from. Well, and I'm going to take a tiny detour for um our very patient non-technical audience members that have maybe listened to this, which is these um posttool call hooks or post stop hooks in Claude can also be used when you're working on non-code. So, we have so many people using claude code to write documents to do all sorts of things. And so you could just think about what do I want automated after this tool is called or what do I want automated after Claude finishes writing my my document. And you could think about ways to use something like this not even for code quality review just for a post kind of task completion check. So I think just the general framework's really useful. It's obviously highly applicable to software development but I think people can think of other creative use cases for this as well. Yeah, absolutely. The the diagramming stuff, create an image of what we just did and send it to my mom to show her I'm working hard. Like anything you want, right? It's it's the sky's is the limit. So, >> okay. So, just to wrap up, these have been super useful use cases. I want to call them out. One is using um documentation and diagramming, specifically mermaid diagrams to preload as a system prompt in your claude code instance so that you don't have to waste the time of doing context discovery and you can really make sure that that context is preloaded. It's a little more expensive on the token side but a lot faster and these diagrams are much more um easily read by machines than by humans. So, it's a good format to get things in. We looked at aliasing some of your favorite Claude code instances and settings so that you can pop into your live dangerously mode. You can pop into your you have all my diagrams mode. Um, you can just pop into those with one, you know, one one or two letters, which I like. Uh, we got a little side preview that we didn't call out, but just how casually you use voice and transcription to enter in and out of these tools. What I like about the way you use AI is you were just like highly efficient. You're like, the minimum number of things I can type the better and you're pretty fluent in switching between voice and typing. So, we saw we saw a little of that. uh you encouraged us to create in particular little command line tools to build one-off ideas or tools. Yours was a website design generator using Nano Banana. And then you showed us how to use um claude hooks and in particular a stop hook to do some quality and other checks on code written by these AI tools and automate some of the processes um that you might do as a software engineer that you want our little AI software engineers to do instead. >> Just that in I'm looking 40 minutes. We did it pretty fast. >> Nice. >> This is great. Okay. Well, I'm going to ask you a couple lightning round questions and then we will get you back to your very efficient AI coding. My first question again, you're like me. We love cursor, we love Claude, we love VS Code. We have all of them open. You know, I think everybody's I think there's interface wars happening right now. Are are people going to love these terminal UIs and command line tools like Claude Code? Do people want the the IDE? I I noticed that you're on cursor 20, so you have the agents view, which is very simple and abstracts away some of the code, and you're in the editor view. I'm going to give you two two wars. I wanted your quick opinion right now. We won't hold you to it, of what you think wins for, I would say real software engineers, you know, writing real code out there. um the the friends that I talk to, you know, terminal UI, IDE or both. And then do you do do you have any hypothesis on I think particular in the the VS fork world, VS Code fork world, are there any modes or you know what do you think how do you think people can compete in the IDE world? >> Yeah, so I think you need both. I think you need an IDE and there are so many use cases for the CLIs. Uh the reason being that the CLIs have a lot of configuration and a lot of settings where um as you saw with the aliases, I could launch a version of cloud that loaded up a specific set of MCPS or a specific set of prompts and preload a bunch of things and do that in a single terminal command and be very um quick and fast with that and then set it off in the background and just have it running. Um, currently inside of uh inside of a cursor or inside of any of these um idees, there's usually a lot of okay, open the UI, navigate to this, and then navigate that, then switch over to this, then switch over to that. Um, and they try and streamline as much as possible with slash commands and whatnot. Um, but it's just not quite the same. But if you have an IDE and you're reading through the files and you're selecting lines and you want to modify certain bits like focused work, um there's so many use cases for IDE where um there there's a recent cloud tool where it has a IDE integration where it can check the diagnostics from the IDE and you'll see that with VS Code as well like the extensions you put into an IDE can be fed back into the agent. So there's a whole robust extensions ecosystem from idees because people build on top of these things their own workflows. And I don't think we've quite reached like we build our own CLIs from AI. I don't see a lot of people building their own cursor extensions or VS Code extensions which are very possible and you could feed those errors and warnings and company rules and everything um in very complex ways back into the agents. Um so that that will happen as well. And I think for one IDE to stand out above the other they have to separate themselves like cursor is doing with their agent mode. Um they have to make something unique and user friendly that once like people are not going to give you a bunch of time to convince them. uh you're going to have to open the agent and you're going to have to like see that click on browser mode and it's going to have to launch your dev server and you're going to have to click on the element and say I want this to look uh uh with more pink or purple or whatever and then um and then they want that to just work. um you'll see any sort of friction or frustration from any AI tool anybody puts out there um is is just instant uh dismissal from so many people like there's just the bar for quality is so high in the AI landscape because everyone can build anything that you have to focus on the UX you have to make that experience better than everyone else and that's where you you can see the cursor making the bold moves of like, okay, let's go full on agents. Like, you have to make those leaps. >> Yeah, I I agree. And, you know, just talking about this skepticism and high bar, what I love about this episode that we recorded today is it's really most relevant for software engineers with more experience, who are shipping highquality code, and who want to write production level code more efficiently using some of these tools. It's this is not, you know, I hope you all hung out and listened to it, but it's not for our vibe coders and our non-technical folks. Um, and so what would you tell kind of senior principal software engineers, engineering leaders? I get asked this a lot about how do I sell the value proposition of these tools into very skeptical organizations and what are as a more advanced software engineer the things that have just changed your life in the last year say you should never go back to doing it this way kind of how do you how do you make that pitch that >> the the first thing that jumps to mind is anytime an issue is opened like you can set up streamlined workflows that someone opens an issue and you can have claude automatically tackle it. You can set up triggers for linear, GitHub, whatever that once something happens, you can get that first pass to see, okay, can we at least find this without doing any work? Can we at least get that initial uh review in there of what's going on so that once we jump into the task I mean for my entire career someone throws an issue at you spend the first you know probably day or two orienting yourself to like okay I didn't write this code this is legacy from let's you get blame let's do all this stuff like all of that busy drudgery that you're going through to even get started on the issue. Um, it can wipe out so much of that. It can find who touched the files, who did this, like if if you have the diagram set up, what are the risks, the impacts, are there potential security things? Are there like it it's so great at surfacing um the you don't know what you don't know sort of scenarios where you hire so many contractors, you hire so many people who uh are new to these things and then you throw them into these tasks and they just don't know like they haven't spent time with the codebase and then um you ask them to fix these things they just have zero idea what sort of impact their changes going to have. The AIS can surface a lot of that and they can just be like, \"Okay, we need to be super careful. This is, you know, in production and um this is cost going to cost us money if this goes wrong. Just tell me everything I need to look at.\" Like find every single debug path. Find every single um uh every why has this file changed over the course of history. Like write a summary of everybody who's touched this file so I can know why this function is the way it is. like there's just so much work that is just not writing code. Um, and all the exploration work is just so much easier to just say like everything I just said over the past, you know, 30 seconds is a prompt, which I could have just dictated, right? Um, and you just have to walk up to your computer and say, \"I have this issue. Like, guide me through all this stuff.\" And um it's just it blows my mind that people be hesitant for those sorts of tools. I I understand if they're like, \"Okay, maybe some of the code isn't perfect. We still have to do code reviews. We still have to like check for quality. We still have to run our tools to validate things.\" But if you're not using it to do to like inspect and investigate and write orientation and all that stuff, then like you're really missing out. like in in the enterprise space. >> Yeah. And on the other end, if you're not using it to document, so the next time somebody has to do that investigation, you have a little bit of an easier time, um you're al also missing out. So I do think on that that front and the back end. And what I often tell people is a good way to think about how to design your AI workflows is do not think in a task level orientation like I'm going to write code. I say, think about if I gave you infinite junior to mid-career talent who is always available, who would do the work you would do if you had unlimited amount of time and no meetings. What would you do when a ticket came in? Like, what would you do? And you'd say, well, I'd go trace who wrote the code. I would go figure out the history. I would make myself a really good tech spec. I would call out the risks. I would publish this in a way that my team could review it. I would have a senior engineer look at it and give me some really hard feedback. All of that could just become a prompt and then you know but so many people are just constrained by their time and and cognitive capacity and so they just go well I'm going to read the issue and I bounce around in the code a little bit and I guess I'm going to start coding. And so, um, you can kind of get to this model of optimal, not perfect, but like optimal workflow and then figure out how you can prompt or build workflows or hooks that would replicate that at least in an 80% way. Um, which is a lot better than not doing it. >> And something as simple as the commit messages are so much better than they used to be because developers didn't have to write them. I >> so much better >> for for people who are new to programming. Um, commit messages used to be like second attempt or like please work swear words like >> my my favorite one is just like 17 FS like or like trying this, trying that, trying this other thing. >> Yeah. Not these work plz. >> Yes. Yeah. You know, if anybody wants to vibe code a product, I always thought that startups would want a printed book of all their first years commit messages >> with like calling out the really funny ones. Oh, if somebody wants to vibe code a little uh GitHub API powered print uh business, I'm sure you could get a couple startups to print those out. Okay, last question. Yeah, >> this is probably challenging for you because you do a lot of dictation. So, you're probably actually pretty polite to AI given you would have to say frustrating things to it if you wanted to be mean. But when our our little friend Claude is going off the rails or you're really not getting what you want, what is your prompting reset start over technique? Have you found any any tricks that work particularly well? Yeah, it's it's really the um take the conversation, export it. A lot of them have the export commands. um drop the conversation with some of the code files into the um into chat GPT pro 5 or whatever it's called or Gemini uh deep think I believe is the and have it have them do a second set of eyes on it and then kind of start over rather than like if if things go off the rails and you can't fix it in about maybe one prompt of like where you see what's going wrong and just revert to the previous commit and kind of start over because there there there's always this underlying the AI is trying to go somewhere and you want it to go over here and you keep on telling it to to join on your path but it still wants to like get somewhere else that you don't quite understand. And so starting over from uh ground zero and like revising your original prompt is better than like trying to steer it to where you are when you've like drifted so far away. Um and that has to do it's so different with every model. It's so different with every prompt and all the context and project that it's like it can't give you like the here's instructions that work every time. But like starting over works every time. tossing a second set of eyes on the entire conversation where that AI isn't uh isn't invested in that conversation. It's instead critiquing the conversation. Um th those are my my two >> I think that second um that second workflow is so funny because I I think as somebody who's been a manager and a leader so many times sometimes I feel like I'm the reasoning model being brought in to mediate the the misunderstanding between two smart but misalign misaligned resources and so it's really funny to hear the idea okay like I am having a debate with my AI let's bring in like the third party. Let's mediate this conversation, have an objective set of eyes to see where we maybe are misunderstanding each other or going wrong and then reset and start start over. So again, I think you know this is the moment for folks with a lot of organizational and social skill thinking um to apply this to how you might design some of these flows um for for AI even though there are um beep boop machines that we're really using. >> Yeah. And and I would say kind of last thought on that is the recent planning modes that have been released with cloud code and cursor and all of them have eliminated a vast majority of that of that drift. >> Um so they've been fantastic releases which I strongly recommend for anything >> beyond like a small file change. Planning is awesome. >> Yeah, I love I love those features too. Okay, well John, this has been great. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Yeah, I'm on eggghhead.io. um that is I have tons of courses on AI tooling. I teach workshops through egghead.io. I send a newsletter out every week called AI dev essentials. Um you can find me on X and other platforms as well under my name. And that's it. I love to talk with anyone about all this stuff. Um my workshops are fun and we talk go way deeper into this super advanced stuff. So yeah. >> Great. and then maybe some of us can shop your possibly to be created Christmas and holiday decoration site. So you let us know >> back on then >> you let us know if that goes live.

    "transcript": "Why has Claude code become your [music] buddy? >> I was writing my notes in my task management tool and that was Trello. As time went on, I just started to get really worried about how am I ever going to get my data out of Trello. And so I was like, I wonder if Claude can help. And that was like one thing. Maybe I could just do this better with Claude. And by moving my task management to Claude, now Claude sees my tasks and I can literally start my day and be like, \"Claude, what's on my to-do list that you can just do for me?\" I can say, \"Hey Claude, what's my sales pipeline right now?\" And because Claude is tagging my tasks, it literally can generate a list of all my sales tasks and where they're at. This has given me a lot of inspiration because I forget a lot of things. There's a lot going on. [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have a very practical episode with Terresa Torres, author of Continuous Discovery [music] Habits, which we all know and love, and internationally acclaimed author, [music] speaker, and coach. Teresa is going to show us how she uses Claude Code for basically everything, but especially to manage her huge to-do list, all the information she needs to do a great job, and builds a giant contact library so she can be, as she says, lazy with her prompting. [music] Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways.

One in three startups in the [music] US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi ai. Teresa, welcome to How I AI. I am so thrilled with today's episode because we get to see what I love, which is good old Claude code in a non-coding environment. And we were laughing before the show. You were just in every directory on your computer straight in the terminal like this is how we're living right now. So, I have to ask you before we get into any of it, why Claude Code? Why has Claude code been become your buddy? >> Yeah, this has been a really gradual evolution. I started like everybody else like literally in chat GPT in the web and then I wanted to have an LLM help me with writing and I gradually moved to Claude because Claude's a little bit better writer although that might be changing. And then you know I do code and I mostly code in the AWS environment and this is going to be really embarrassing. I do most of my coding in the AWS management console and my husband for like four years has been like Teresa you just need to use a ID and I was kind of afraid of a ID. I literally had no version control. But I recently had a project where one of the things that I built is being integrated into a real production quality product. And I was like, \"Oh, I got to level up my engineering game.\" And that got me into VS Code. And then because I needed to use like Git and be like a real engineer if I was going to have something I built go in a real product. And so um I had to level up my pretend engineering game. And my husband was like, \"And look, you can just have Claude in the terminal right here inside VS Code.\" And then that was a gamecher. And it I think the reason why coding with Claude helped me with all the things we're going to talk about today is I feel like engineers pair program with Claude when they use Cloud Code. And I think this idea of pair programming, I pair program now with everything I do, even if it's not programming. So like I pair task manage and I pair right and I pair everything. >> Great. And so let's get into it because you are going to show us task management. And I mean the running joke is like every every third startup is going to be a to-do list. Like if you haven't tried to start a to-do list startup, are you really like an early stage founder? But you have coded yourself a task management platform that works for you and I'd love for you to walk us through it. >> Yeah. And I'll explain why I did this. I I actually think the reason why there's so many task management apps is that how we manage our tasks is so idiosyncratic that this is exactly the type of thing that you should build for yourself because it can work exactly the way you want it to work which is part of the magic. But what got me here was I'm a huge noteaker. like instead of thinking out loud, I think by outlining and writing notes and I was writing my notes in my task management tool and that was Trello. And this is kind of nightmarish because now my notes are locked into a third party tool. They weren't very searchable and like as time went on I just started to get really worried about how am I ever going to get my data out of Trello. And so I was like, I wonder if Claude can help. And that was like one thing, like maybe I could just do this better with Claude. And then the second thing that got me into this was as I started to get more involved in AI, I forced myself every time I did a task to ask, how can AI help with this? Can it automate it? Can it augment it? Do I like doing it? Do I want AI to do it for me? And by moving my task management to Claude, now Claude sees my tasks and I can literally start my day and be like, Claude, what's on my to-do list that you can just do for me? Or what's on my to-do list where I should be thinking about how you can help? And then it's not all on me to figure out how to use AI. Claude's kind of my pair AI buddy. So what I built is I have a slash command slash today. Are people familiar with slash commands? Should I describe that? >> You should definitely describe them. Okay, so a slash command is just a claude code shortcut that we get to define. So I decided it was called slashto today. I wrote a really detailed prompt which we can look at. Um that tells Claude exactly what to do every time I type slash today. So every single morning of my life, even on Saturdays and Sundays with my cup of coffee, I sit down and I literally just type in slash today. And if I run this, it's going to overwrite what I'm going to show you, but we'll run it real live in a minute. But what it does, you can see the summary from this morning's output. It checks my Trello board. So, I still use Trello to coordinate with my team. Says there were no new cards, nothing new to add to my list. It generates a today file, which is what we're looking at here in Obsidian. This is it's gone through all of my tasks that are just markdown files and told me what's due today. We're late in the day, so I've done a lot of my to-do list. I am like every other human. I have a long list of overdue tasks that I have not done and they always end up at the top of my to-do list. And tasks are things that have due dates, right? Like they're things I have to do by a certain time. I also have a whole folder full of ideas, just things that I want to get to someday. And you can see I have four ideas that are currently in progress. These get added to my to-do list every day so that when I make it to the end of my list, I can be like, \"Okay, what should I be working on that's more longterm?\" And then we're going to talk about this, I think, next, but I do have this kind of plugin that I created that does research queries for me every day. And then every day on my to-do list, I get um my research digest to review and save papers that I want to um summarize and and learn from. And that's it's it's such a simple workflow, but what's behind the scenes, if I go over here on the left, I just have different folders. These are literally markdown files. We're in Obsidian. when I have a bugs folder, I have an ideas folder, I have a tasks folder, and then if we look at a task, a task has some front matter. So front matter is an obsidian concept. It's just like field type and then value. Um it's it's YAML behind the scenes for people familiar with that. And so I have type tasks, a task has a due date, and then there's tags. And every single one of my tasks has this. And so what's happening when I run my today command is Claude is just searching my tasks folder for anything that has a due date of today. >> And I have to ask just behind the scenes, is the Trello data being pulled via the Atlassian MCP or how is it actually accessing all this data data? Is Obsidian stored locally? Like how does this all stitch together? >> Yeah. So I actually don't use Trello anymore at all. I'll tell you why. I have a Trello MCP server, but I don't like when now when I want to create a task, I don't go create it on my Trello board. I literally We can demo this new task. Send. Thank you to Claire. Very sweet. I was a blast. And then Claude has like has all the context for how my task management system works because I'm Claude is open in my tasks folder. And you can see here it's creating a file in my tasks. It set the due date to today. >> It hasn't added tags which is kind of a problem. We'll see if it figures it out. >> Oh, it's being very smart. So, because it added something to my today list, it knows it needs to update my today this file that we're looking at. I actually don't want it to do it this way because it's going to remove all my checklists and I like feeling like I did my stuff. So, I'm going to just tell it to just manually add it. Um, so that's this script that it just tried to run is kind of telling you the behind the scenes of how this today slash command works. There is a Python script behind this that like does that it that does that like search all the tasks for anything that is due today. Search for anything that's past due. And you can see here that like now it just shows up on my to-do list. And this sounds so silly, but I didn't have to open a web browser. I didn't have to click through 14 different buttons in a guey that is constantly changing. I didn't have to like click on a date picker and then click a label and then move it to the right list. Like I literally just typed like off-the-cuff notes to Claude. And because I work in Claude all day every day, this task window is always open. And then I usually have a second session open for whatever project I'm working on. And so I can always just bounce over and be like, \"Hey, new task.\" Or, \"Hey, a new idea.\" And it's just it's it's the speed of it is what I really love about it. It's that I don't have to think about anything. >> And then why put Obsidian in the loop? It's something you already had. It has a lot of context. It's structured the way you want it. You know, these could be just raw markdown files and you could just X them off the way they're shown above. What do you think that extra layer is for you? >> I was not an Obsidian user before this and I'll say I wasn't even comfortable with Markdown at the beginning. Like let's go back six, eight months. Like I was not a comfortable markdown user. I There's a few things I like. I like the really tactile like it's silly, but I like checking the box. I know I can put >> I was going to ask. >> Yeah, I know I can put an X in a box and markdown. It's not quite the same. Um, really what I like is the file browser on the left. And if you'll notice, my vault is not set at tasks. It's set higher than that. So, I have, and we'll talk about my LLM context, but I have like my LLM context, all my notes across everything, some podcast files that I use to work with my podcast. This is the research stuff we're going to get into, all my tasks, some skills that I've been trying to experiment with, my writing. And so I kind of think about Obsidian as my file browser. And because it's all in markdown, it makes everything I do super accessible to Claude. And then I can do things like I can say, \"Hey Claude, what's my sales pipeline right now?\" And because Claude is tagging my tasks, it literally can generate a list of all my sales tasks and where they're at on the fly. So like for most task management, you're limited to what views they create or you can use tags, but who who manually tags things? I I'm optimistic I'll do that but I never do it. Whereas in this system cla does all the tagging. Anytime it generates a task it'll think about what tags to add. And then in my claude MD for this project not for my global one for this project. We keep a taxonomy of what tags we're using and we kind of manage that. When I see things I don't like I update that cloud MD so that like I'm co-creating it with Claude. Uh but Claude's doing all the heavy lifting. So I want to recap this before we go to the next workflow which is you've created a slash command in cloud code to look at your tasks and assemble basically assemble your tasks from today. You have a structured task document format in Obsidian that every task goes into with like a title, a due date, some tags that automatically get populated and some context. And then you have a couple like known commands you can use in Claude that allow you to add, remove, update, whatever those tasks on the fly. And this just gives you the personalized experience you want for your to-do list connected across all your sources. And then in case it slipped by people, I do want to call out you noted that Claude can have sort of like project level instructions and global level instructions. And I think this is something that people don't take enough advantage of is context scoping their cla files to the right area so that you could have one for your task management list that's really focused. You have a global one for all your properties etc etc. So I think I think I have your flow. This has given me a lot of inspiration because I just I forget a lot of things. There's a lot there's a lot going on. >> Okay. I'm going to show you like here's the real value. Like let's say I'm doing this task. This is a too simple of a task. Let's do I'm working on launching a course, right? And over if if as I get onto this like let's say I'm like right before this I was like half done updating the sales page and then let's say I find a bug in my course platform and I need to document this bug. I take all my notes literally while I'm doing the task and it's all embedded and again it's all text. So if later, like tomorrow, I come back and be like, where in the world did I log that bug because I did it lazily in my notes and I didn't actually create a bug, I can be like, \"Claude, help me find this thing that I don't know where it's at.\" And like, I don't know about you, I don't know if you've used Trello, but I think any task management tool that I could say this about, the search is not that good and it's not that good at searching all the context in the task. And that's what I really love from this is that like I can't figure it out, but Claude will try every permutation of searches till it finds it. Even if I'm remembering the words wrong, I'll be like, \"Hey, I have a thing called new blog post tomorrow.\" And it'll be like, \"I can't find anything called new blog post tomorrow, but I have this thing that says article Wednesday. Is that what you're looking for?\" And I'll be like, \"Whoa, Claude, that is what I'm looking for.\" >> Yeah. I don't think we say it enough that these are really great local search engines for for content. I mean, we use it so much in code all the time. I'm like, \"Hey, can you remind me how XYZ worked?\" Or, \"I think I shipped this feature. Can you remind me exactly how it was implemented or who did it?\" But you can apply that same framework, that same like search framework to kind of any textbased tool. And these these tools are really good at grabbing that context. Well, speaking of finding useful context, you have a second workflow around research I would love for you to walk us through. So, how do you assemble all this research that helps you do your job? >> Okay. So, I aspire to be an academic, which is weird, but I do. And I really want to keep up on academic research on a lot of topics. In fact, we can go over here and look at my topics. So, like I do a lot about I'm I'm really interested in this research around like synthetic users and should we be letting AI do interview synthesis for us? I'm interested in team collaboration, creativity, discovery skills, whatever. Lot education because I teach personas because it's a super hot topic. And I really want to know like what are we learning from academic research? I happen to have access to a university library which is great, but I never have the discipline to like go search for things. There's never a moment in my day where I'm like, \"Oh, I'm bored. I should go do this.\" But I wish that I did. Right? And so what I did, and this is also one of the nice things about using Claude as my task manager, is I can integrate it right into my task manager. So I'm going to start by showing you the output of this and then I'll talk about how I built it. So every day on my to-do list, I get a little research digest. It's giving me the search results from a daily archive search. So archive is a pre-print server. It's where most papers now, thanks to COVID and postcoid, get published before they're published for real. What's nice is they're free and they're they're fast. They're real time. What's not nice is it's before they're edited edited. So, you have to be your own filter. Um, it does a search and then I get a markdown file with all the results. So, this is like this is literally today's file. I have not gone through it yet. But then when I go through it, if I open a PDF and I download it, I save it to these topic folders. And in each of these topic folders, there's a source directory and a notes directory. So my PDF goes in sources. And this is going to matter in a second. And then um what happens the next day after I've saved a PDF is on this research today digest I get summaries of every paper I saved the day before. and I get really detailed summaries of like not kind of the halfbaked here's a paragraph of what the paper is about. But I wrote this skill to like very um to focus on like the methods of the paper and the effect size things that like are going to because I have to be the editor. There's no editor for these papers yet. Things that can help me decide is this worth reading? Does it look like it had a big enough effect size? Did it look like it was a a good study? And I have a funny story about this. The day I built this, I was reviewing my daily digest and I saw this paper on purchase intent and I read this and I had it summarized and I read the summary and because it was like in this nice summary format, I realized this flaw. I was like, \"Oh, they use this purchase intent survey that's not very reliable. Like it's not an accurate measure of purchase intent.\" And the next day in on LinkedIn, I saw Ethan Mollik shared the paper and I was like, \"Oh, this is kind of a crummy paper, Ethan.\" And I reshared it and I basically said, \"Here's why we don't have to care about this paper.\" And I outlined like a very critical review of the study. And the only reason why I could do that is because I had this system and I'd already looked at the paper that had just come out. I had already like analyzed it and critiqued it and like is there something we can learn from this? And then I wrote a really detailed LinkedIn post about it and it's honestly one of my most best performing posts on LinkedIn ever. >> Well, there you go. And what I have to ask is how does this get triggered? Is this automatically? Is this triggered off that today command? >> How does that work? >> So I did integrate it into my today command. Um, but the way it works, I built this as a plugin. It is available as a public repo. I will say it's still being tested. It has a it has one user. My husband is going to be the second user. Um and if you want to be the third user, we can make it available. It is a public repo, but use at your own caution. It's still in development. Um it's what's funny about this is the only part of this that really requires AI is the paper summaries. But the part I would not have been able to build this without AI. So, I basically just explained to Claude like, \"Here's what I want. I want to run a daily search. I want a digest on my to-do list. Like, how are we gonna make this happen?\" >> And what's happening under the hood is I have two Python scripts. One of them every morning searches archive. And then every Sunday is searches Google Scholar and it's keeping track of what papers we've already seen, what papers are new, and it's searching based on a config file of my personally defined keywords. And then every night I have a second script and these are cron jobs. They just run on my computer like on a schedule. And then at night, it's that second script is looking through my source directories in my research directory for any new PDFs, and it's creating a to-do list for my today command. Um, that to take all the papers in that list, trigger cloud code agents to generate the summaries, and then the summaries get added to this research today file. >> And do you still have to download those PDFs manually? I am downloading those PDFs manually and I I could like there is enough information in the um the search results that I probably could download them automatically but I don't it's >> even by hand selecting what papers I want to summarize it's like already a fire hose >> so I want a filter like I don't if we look at my digest like I don't need to read >> I don't need to read all of these papers like >> I there's there's some of them that are going to pop out as like, oh, that's really relevant to what I do. I'm going to grab that PDF. >> So, I spend like five to 10 minutes a day just looking at this and downloading papers and then I forget about it and then the very next day I get those summaries. >> That's awesome. And are there any other, you know, you've you've you've spoken about sort of archive and these academic sources. Have you thought about creating this for other sources of market information that are maybe useful? Yeah. So, I wrote a blog post like my I wrote a blog post called um Claude Code, what is it, how it's different, and why non-technical people should use it. >> Yeah. >> And in that blog post, I gave this scenario. I was trying to go from like total beginner to magical moment. And so the magical moment I created was in that one blog post, you learn about the terminal, you learn about claude code, and by the end, claude code has generated a very detailed competitive analysis for whatever competitors you tell it with like a detailed price comparison table, a detailed feature comparison table because I think like this is the type of stuff Claude is really good at. It can go query things. It can aggregate things. It can create reports. And so I've been starting to think about like what I would love is this same research report for like LinkedIn posts that are relevant to my because like I want to go be part of the conversation and comment on things but when I log into LinkedIn I kind of want to stab my eyes out and so like I need a filter right um LinkedIn's API makes that really hard. So, >> I know I was gonna say this is a call for a LinkedIn MCP here. So, we can just access LinkedIn through the dark mode terminal. And >> we'll have to figure out how to like push their ads through dark through MCP before they do that. Um, but I do think there are a lot of applications for this that like people that aren't interested in the academic research side. Um, I mean Claude, I'm using Claude to Google for me. I don't really go to Google anymore. This episode is brought to you by Graphite, the AI powered code review platform [music] helping engineering teams ship higher quality software faster.

You need a way to filter and aggregate and work through it. And then your sort of inbound knowledge, you know, sources are so overwhelming. You need to figure out a way to filter, summarize, and operationalize this. I really like this. But then I'm guessing at the end of the day, you have a bunch of tasks you've done and you haven't done and a bunch of research that you've read or you haven't read and you I mean like all Obsidian uh users or like all extreme notetakers which I expect you to be just have a lot of information to go through. And so how have you thought about organizing using that local context, that memory um to make something like Claude Code do a good job on your behalf? >> Yeah, so I definitely have overdue tasks. That's why I went back to my to-do list here. And actually, this looks like a really nice clean view. If we went to my ideas folder, you know, like there's just too much to do, right? And so one of the things that I've been really playing with is I have this mantra in my head of like automation or augmentation. So like when I when when I have a new task come up, can Claude just do this for me or should Claude be helping me do this? And I love this because it's helped me be really reflective about like what do I want to keep doing? What do I want the robot to do for me? Right? I mean, not literally a robot, but you get the idea. And I realized the more context I provide to Claude, the more Claude can do for me. And so I have a Obsidi obsidian vault that is literally just for Claude. And I called it LM context because sometimes I switch to codecs. It doesn't matter which model you're using. And I just have like a ton of information to find. This is going to look overwhelming. I did not create this all at once. I did it very iteratively over time. The way that I built it is as I was finding myself describing things to Claude, I'd be like, \"Okay, Claude, what did we learn today that should go in a context file and Claude has written these context files for me?\" So, the first one I did was a writing style guide. So, I just sort of told Claude, I said, \"Hey, I actually didn't tell Claude who I was to start this. I just said, go to product talk and tell me um what you think the author's writing style is. Who's the audience? what's the philosophy? Like, what's the tone? And Claude actually went to my blog and read it and started writing stuff. And then I looked at it and I was like, \"Yeah, this kind of right. That's not really right. Let's fix this.\" And so, we co-created a writing style guide. This is super long. I did not write this myself at all. Like, Claude did all of the heavy lifting. But, there's so much in here. Like, there's a section on how my book writing is versus my blog writing. We have a section on headlines. We have a section on subheaders. We have a section on like key phrases I like to use. Never do this, always do that. And what it means, I don't let I rarely let Claude write for me, but Claude critiques all of my writing. And by having a really detailed writing style guide like this, Claude's critiques are spot-on, right? Because it knows my goals. It knows my audience. It knows who I'm trying to write for. It knows how I'm trying to write. And then I do the same thing for I have a business profile, a personal profile. I have a ton of business context. Uh for marketing, I have like who my audience is, brand guidelines, my marketing channels, uh I don't know what that content architecture one is. That's probably something Claude created. Content assets, like just there's a ton here, right? The metrics I track, my publication schedule. I probably should not open partnerships. All of my products, right? Like all my individual courses, my subscription products, whatever. Um, and then each of these files just has content about that. And here's what I learned doing this. At first, I started putting everything in my CloudMD. Like literally everything went in my CloudMD. But then I realized like Claude loads my CloudMD every single time. I don't want all this context in there, right? And you'll notice like I have a business folder, but I also have a personal folder. I have a business profile and a personal profile. One of the most common things I use LLM for are like, \"Holy crap, my dog just ate this. Is she safe?\" Claude does not need to know what my marketing channels are or my blog post archive when it's telling me my dog's not going to die, right? And so it got me thinking about like to do context well, it's not just that we have to document everything. We have to document everything in teenytiny files so that when we ask Claude to do a task, we can give Claude just the context it needs to do that task. Well, and then I don't ever tell Claude when to use these files. Like if we look at my business profile, >> this is just an index. It's telling Claude, \"This is what's available to you. You can find my company overview here. You can find um details about these courses here. Here's some other products I have. So that whenever I ask Claude to do something, it says in my global Claude MD, if I ask you for help with something related to my business, use my business profile. If I ask you for help with something personal, use my personal profile. So then based on what I asked Claude, it will load these profiles and then based on the content of what I asked it, it'll pick which of these context files to add to the conversation. And then that makes sure I can be super lazy in my prompts. I can be like, Claude, blog post review, give me feedback, right? And it'll just look at the topic of a blog post and like pull my audience file and look at who what what the product I'm referring to is. And it just helps. Yeah, I I think this um file this index file strategy is something that we hear a lot from how I AI guests, which is you want any individual context space or information to be relatively short and relatively focused, but you want to give the LLM a map to those places. And so I almost think of this as like if you had a filing cabinet and you had to take a random person an an intern off the street and you said here's my task. If you go in this filing cabinet you'll be able to figure out how to do it. How do you structure you know what do you t what's the instructions you tape on top of the filing cabinet that says this is how this filing cabinet works. But then like how easy can you make it to discover exactly what context, what task, and the like the step-by-step workflow you want somebody to follow is really the mental model you want to set up when working with something like a claude code on a wide variety of tasks. And then you can be very lazy and be like, \"Go write me a blog post on XYZ.\" Um, and and it can discover pretty naturally how to get there. I think there's one piece I would add to that which is I think it's really easy to think about like we got to give the LM a lot of context but I think there's a correlary to that which is if we give it too much irrelevant context it's still going to not be very good at its job and so like it was a big leap for me to realize this needs to be a lot of small files like I don't want one file with all my products because if we're working on one product it doesn't need to know about the other products >> and that I mean I think that is the difference between like throwing doing a, you know, 2,000page user manual on someone's desk and saying somewhere in here is the answer versus an organized set of kind of like files and folders with little labels like how to write a blog post or what our products are. And so I do think just the form factor of how you store your context allows you to be as you said what we all want to be a little lazy when totally finding. I'm lazy even in how I create these. Like the way that I create context files is anytime I'm finishing a session with Claude code, I just go, \"Claude, what'd you learn today that we should document?\" And I make Claude do it. Yep. I love it. Well, I have to ask you one last thing because you are such an exceptional writer and put out excellent content, but I know you use a little Claude to do a little of that. And I'm just curious how you get Claude to be an effective writing buddy. Maybe it's exactly what you said, which is it's a reviewer. It enforces your style guide, but have you found, this is like the million-dollar question for everybody. Have you found a way to make AI writing less terrible? >> Yes and no. I Okay, I love to write. So, I really like this is when I ask that question of augmenting versus automating. I don't want to automate writing. I will share I have written two blog posts where an LLM did the bulk of the writing. I've been very transparent about this. The first one is I interviewed 11 people about how they're using lovable and I had um chat GPT turn those transcripts into individual stories that I shared. So like I didn't write those individual stories. I wrote the intro. I wrote the conclusion. I made sure they sounded normal. And then my blog post that's coming out tomorrow actually is themes that are coming out from my um podcast just now possible. And I had Claude do a lot of the writing on that. That was a little bit more heavy lifting. Um but for the most part I still do all my writing. And what I rely on Claude for is um while I'm writing usually in Obsidian with Claude open in a terminal right next to me. I'll be like, I'll realize I wrote something and wonder if it's true and be like, \"Claude, I think this. Is there any evidence that this is true?\" And Claude will go off and research and I'll go back to writing. Or I'll write my intro and I'll be like, \"Claude, I wrote my intro. Can you tell me how to make the hook stronger?\" And it will like read my intro and tell me what it likes and doesn't like. Or um I'll write a section and I'll be like, \"Okay, Claude, review the section, what's good, what's not good.\" And then Claude's not just giving me generic feedback, right? Because I've written this style guide. It knows how I how I aspire to write. So then when it tells me what's good and what's not working, it's doing it based on my own goals that I've told it like here's how I want you to critique my writing. And then my favorite is it just fixes my typos as I go. So then I can type really lazily and not care that I'm spelling everything wrong. >> Um yes, I have indulged in fancy nails lately. Other people who have watched this podcast have seen me type terribly with my fancy nails, and it has allowed me to enjoy fancy nails without having to fix my typos, which are >> uh very abundant these days. So, I think that's great. Okay, so to recap all of your workflows, which I think is great, we went really deep on your to-do list. Um I kind of agree everybody just has this particular way they want to manage themselves and they want to manage their list. is the perfect perfect use case for building something yourself. So, if anybody out there is looking for a personal project, highly recommend getting started with a customized to-do list, maybe hear in cloud code like you've done it. You showed us how you can do a daily automation and summarization of information that you find useful, which allows you to engage in broader market conversations that you wouldn't have the time or capacity to do in an in-depth in-depth way. And that's driving, I'm sure, great things for your business, as well as just making you a more informed leader and voice in the market. We've gotten really organized around your local context and memory system. You clearly love a structured file and a structured folder. So, I have to acknowledge that. That's amazing. And then while you rarely write LLM first, you found that Claude code in particular, Claude is a really great writing buddy to keep you sort of like on the rails, do research for you, give you feedback, like make incremental fixes and fix typos and grammatical errors. So just that. >> Do you Okay, so I'm going to go to lightning round questions because I do have to ask you a few other things. clearly love clawed code but are what else? Do you use anything else? What are some other daily drivers for you? Are you always in dark mode terminal? >> I am often in dark mode terminal. I do use VS Code. So when I'm writing code, I do still prefer to be in an IDE and have like colorful diffs. As far as other AI products, it's funny. Everybody asks me like what about cursor? I actually have never used it. I know it's amazing. I try like the way that I deal with the overwhelm of just the fire hose of information is I try to only seek out a new product when there's something wrong with what I'm using. So like I uncover a gap. I'll be like, \"Okay, now I got to go find to fill this gap.\" And a lot of this setup of like claude code with Obsidian or Claude code in VS Code just works really well for me that I haven't tried in a lot of other stuff. I would say the only other like big AI product I'm using on a regular basis. I still occasionally use chat GPT in the browser usually because like I'll be doing something else in the browser and it's just easy to pop over to chat GPT or I use um Descript for video editing and I it is one of the like I can't think of very many like nonfoundation lab AI products that I love but I love Descript. Yeah, we use it to edit the the podcast and what a delightful change in user experience from what you used to have to do to what you can do >> editing video by editing editing a text transcript is just the most magical thing that exists. >> Yes. And if you missed it, um the founder of Descript did a early How I AI podcast talking nothing about their AI product, but did talk about how he opened a which I think is open now, a East Bay, I think it's in Oakland or Berkeley, um uh board board game business [clears throat] >> using basically chat GBT as as a co-founder. So don't miss that one. >> I listened to that episode. But I don't think I realized it was from the descript. >> It was. And I got the funniest text from a friend who said, \"This is the most Bay Area thing ever. Two guys that don't think that they can arrange a board game without putting AI in the middle.\" [laughter] >> Yes. >> Okay. So, um, my second question for you, we've already asked for the LinkedIn API MCP. We're fine being advertised, too. So any of you LinkedIn PMs out there, we are fine getting inline advertisements as long as we don't have to log in so we can read read our content in the terminal. What else do you wish was out there to power your tool? Maybe it's not an AI tool, but maybe it's a data source. You know, LinkedIn is pretty high on the list. Like I just I hate AI generated content. I think this is why I still do my own writing because reading other people's AI generated contents comments kind of breaks my soul a little bit. >> Um, so I think LinkedIn is probably the big one. Although there's probably a hundred times a day where I'm like, why can't I just do this thing, >> but I don't know. I get pretty far with Claude. Claude can teach me how to do anything, which I really like. LinkedIn. These are these are two two people who uh want to reach a business audience because I once I I've solidly told everybody if you want to run a business like I run I'm sure if you want to run a business like you run you got to live on LinkedIn. It's just a reality. >> There's a second one and I know this is getting better but it's still not good. I really want text to image where like they can close the quotation mark on the quote in the image. >> Yeah. >> You know, like that's that's the only one I really want. >> Yep. Okay. Okay. We'll we'll make this ask out there. Anybody working on those products, please, we will be beta testers for you. Okay. And then last and final question and we will get you out of here. When AI, when your buddy Claude is just not listening, not doing what you want, writing terrible slop, what is your prompting technique? Do you Are you all caps? Do you just do you quit? Do you kill Claude? What do you do? I kind of kill Claude. I use clear excessively. Um, and I think that's what got me on this context file thing is that like I don't really want to rely on the conversation history because when Claude gets stuck, I want Claude to go away and I want a clean state slate and I want to start over, but I don't want to have to reexplain all my context to Claude. So, I've built a lot of tips and tricks to like constantly be keeping documentation about what we're doing while we're doing it so that when Claude doesn't listen, I can just be like slashcle, we're starting over. >> [laughter] >> I wish I could do that in my in my human conversations. Like we have all the information we need. It is not getting us to an agreement. Let's just slash clear and start. >> We have gone round and round. Stop. Let's do it over. >> All right. Well, Teresa, this has been great. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful to you? >> Yeah, so I blog at productt talk.org. Lately, I have been blogging a ton about cloud code. So, if you found this stuff interesting, there's going to be much more coming. Um, and then I recently started a podcast called Just Now Possible, and it's more about uh I interview crossf functional product teams about how they're putting AI into production, which is super fun. Um, and so you can check that out as well at justnowsible.com. >> Yeah, smash that subscribe button, check it out. Sounds awesome. Well, thank you so much for joining How I AI.

One of the things that Codex is great at is simply answering questions. If you have a chat where Codex is producing these plans and you want to change something, it's actually really nice for the model if you just use the same chat to ask for changes to the plan and that way it has all this context in its head when it's ready to get going. This is a great starter flow that shows how flexible this platform is and how it can meet a bunch of people at a variety of levels of tasks. How is OpenAI using this for bigger features and bigger products? >> We used Codex to build a sore app for Android in 28 days [music] and it immediately became the number one app in the app store.

I'm excited about today's episode because we actually haven't seen a deep dive into codeex yet and we are going to get the expert take on how to get the most out of this tool. And I love that we're just going to dive in and do a 0ero to one hello world with Codeex. So if you're a software engineer or somebody who's even just new to using some of these AI tools, where would you get started with Codex? >> Codex is a coding agent. We're building it into a full software engineering teammate. But to get started, let's just talk about where most people use it, which is in their IDE. Uh I happen to use VS Code. So I'll show you Codex in VS Code. You can also use it uh the Codex extension in any VS code fork like cursor, etc. So let's say that I just installed Codex from the VS Code extension marketplace. Do you want me to show that by the way or? >> Yeah, let's do it. Let's truly zero. All right. Okay. Truly zero to one. I mean, I'm not going to uninstall and log out, but we can pretend I did that. Yes, I love it. >> Pretend I clicked on install and then I clicked in. Right. So, what would happen then is I'm going to get this glyph here, uh, which is the Codex extension. I have to click through some steps and log in. And so, in case you didn't know, Codex is included in your charge PT plan. So, you need a paid plan. So, if you have a plus plan, pro, uh, business team or EDU, you can use Codex. Um, and the limits are really generous. Okay. So, let's say I have this thing up and truly zero to one. Let's pretend I like actually I just heard that this is a game, but I don't even know how to play this game. Uh, one of the things that Codex is great at is simply answering questions. I'm the product lead for Codex. So, I I actually use Codex a lot for asking questions, probably more than most engineers do, cuz I don't want to bother engineers with silly questions. So, I might ask, how do I play this game? We just launched a new model today. So, I'm actually curious what model that used. 5.2. Cool. We're going to talk about that, I guess. So, I'm just going to run npm rundev here as it's saying, boot up the server and let's take a look at the game. Okay, so what I have here is like a simple commander type game. I can move my character around. Um, I can recruit troops. It looks like planting windmills is not implemented yet. And I've heard there's something wrong with the jump. Okay, that's way too high. So, let's get to work fixing some of these issues. So, what I can do here is I can just go and ask, let's just say that jump is way too big. Uh, lower, please. And so uh for those of you who are new to coding agents, I mean this is pretty pretty basic. I just wrote in plain natural language, plain English what the change that I wanted. And we can see codeex getting to work thinking up of a plan. Okay, I need to figure out how the jump works. I need to then reduce it and then I need to like make sure this whole thing works. So let's do that. And uh while we're at it, let's make some more changes as well. How about we uh implement the windmill planting? Um I'm just doing these in your chat so they can go in parallel. Yeah, I I want to call out some stuff for for folks listening or not watching. So, what you're basically showing is the process of starting with an existing codebase and you as a let's just pretend you're a semi-technical user. You're like a product manager on this and you're like, eh, you know, they ship something but not exactly what you want. What you're using codecs for is one, how do I even run this thing locally? which I think is just such a you know people forget these basic use cases because I know there are a lot of software engineers that listen to this podcast but people forget like not everybody knows how to run every repo locally. So, one little thing you can do is like just how do I get this codebase running so I can test it? And then two, you're setting up little parallel tasks, which I think is really nice and I'm curious, you know, how many of these do you find yourself doing on anyone anyone codebase to just fix little things? And so I guess my question for you is on these parallel tasks which in this example are very small. Do you feel like it's a better approach to set up parallel tasks and just have you know individual ones running or to do them in sort of a serial basis? Like why one or the other? >> This totally depends. So like this is a bit of a toy project but realistically like the way that I I typically work if I'm like running around. Um so this is like very tactical to like I guess PMs. So I'm looking at a terminal here and I often just have some like question that I want to know about. So actually like literally this morning I was like okay I'm going to do a demo. I know we just launched a new feature that makes it easier to pick models. Can I disable that? And so I ran codeex which popped me in. Uh this is just some internal auto update logic that I ran codeex and then I asked hey uh we have this new feature. By the way I don't mind telling you guys about it because open source so a lot of new things are just like out there in public. We have this new feature that offers um balanced reasoning settings. I'm going to quote it actually to give the model a clue that I wanted to search that string. Uh reasoning settings. How do I disable that for the demo? So, you know, I might do this kind of thing like super frequently or I might be like, \"Hey, I heard a customer report about this behavior. Is that done?\" Or I might ask a question like, \"Hey, uh did we ship this feature? I I like I lost track of whether or not we shipped something.\" So, I ask these kinds of questions a lot. And when I do this, running them in parallel is like great, there's no reason to to do anything else. On the other hand, if I'm making changes, then I'm more likely to think about, okay, how likely is this change to conflict with another change? >> And typically, I'll either do one at a time or I'll use something called a work tree, which is, I guess, a bit more of an advanced concept. U, we can get into that if you're interested. Uh, I'll use a work tree and I'll just spend send codeex off to do its work on a separate work tree. No, let's take let's take a minute to to look at work trees because I think this is something that um most folks that are new to these tools aren't really using particularly well. I see sort of the two paths that you showed which is one I'm just going to do like one big branch do these things in serial and then commit them in or two I'm just going to like kick off a bunch of different tasks but they're all going in the same conflicting space and creating issues. And so maybe we take a minute and talk about work trees and how those work within codeex or how you set them up and use them to make sure that you can run par parallel changes but that they don't conflict with each other and can be reviewed separately. >> Basically, if we're going to have codeex make changes and maybe I can come up with an example on the fly. Let's say that we want to change like the language of this input to like French or German. Like obviously those both can't be true at the same time. This is a very contrived example, right? But maybe I want to try both. Maybe I'm prototyping something. Mhm. >> What I need then is I need two different copies of the codebase. So I could just copy the codebase twice, right? Like just command C, command V in finder or I could get clone the the repo twice. But Git has this really nice affordance called a work tree which basically lets one get instance track multiple copies of the codebase. So uh you know as a as sort of a classic mammal, I am lazy and so I don't want to remember the commands for workree even though they're very simple. So typically the way that I would actually do this is I would just ask Codex to create work trees. So I might say something like Codex and uh I could launch Codex like I just did and type the prompt. But a shortand what's kind of nice in Codex is you can just put your prompt right in. So I might say codeex in here uh create two new work trees uh off the main branch. I might not be this super explicit if I was actually doing it. main branch, one called French and one called German. And so what you can see happen just here is that Codex just launched and went straight into this prompt. I do this all the time. In fact, I I've gotten so used to running this that sometimes I will forget to write codeex- quote and I will literally just do something like this. Uh I'll be in terminal, I'll say in here, do this. Yeah, I was I was just looking at this because this we're in a very meta repository right now which is in you're in a folder in called codecs running codecs talking to codeex. It's all you know it's codecs all the way down as they would say. But yeah, I think this is an important one to call out for folks that are not watching the YouTube and maybe are listening is you can type as you open a new codeex instance in the CLI, you can type this dash dash and your first prompt right in one line. And this is like classic developer productivity. It's like I cannot be expected to press enter, wait, and then type my words. Exactly. >> Um, so I love this. Okay, so then what you've done here is you've used codeex um to do what we all use codeex for, which is not have to memorize git cli commands and you're creating two new git work trees off main. And then I'm presuming as you work inside codeex, what you're saying is like, okay, in the French work tree do ABC and in German do XYZ. >> Yeah. So let's let's actually show working in those work trees. So if you see here, I now have two folders. >> I have one called French and one called German. So what I might just do is I might CD into French. And then um I might run codeex. Uh let's go in and I'll just say translate the input field placeholder strings strings to French. Again, very contrived example. >> Yep. >> So now I can open a new tab. And what I will do is I will now cd into the German tab instead. and I'll run codeex. I'll use my nice shortcut to just immediately give it the command and I'll say translate the input placeholder string to German. And so now Codex can go work on both of these changes at the same time. Here's the French one going. It's figuring out where to do this. Here's the German one going. And so that's awesome. >> You know, we have a lot of people that, you know, go go on social media and they're like, we're running I'm running 15 instances of codecs across my terminal. They show all these tabs, but they're not sharing practically how they're creating separation of concerns across this code. And you know, I I love that we're showing AI tools, but I think also what these coding tools are allowing people to do is come to software engineering a lot of times without the basics of things like Git. And so, you know, it's in addition to learning some of these AI tools, if I could tell anybody like learn the fundamentals of Git and then you will be in a safe space when you're we're when you're running with the power of these tools, I think is is really important. Okay. So, you know, what we've shown is you can spin up codecs kind of in one of two ways, which I also want to call out. One, in your IDE through an extension plugin. Two, if you just want to go straight into the terminal experience, great. You can you know ask it to do either ex explanatory tasks which is I use it a lot even on code I have written myself [laughter] like what what you know what did I do here remind me how this works >> as well as sort of discrete tasks and then you can parallelize these especially by using >> work trees. So I think this is a is a great you know kind of like foundational how you would use some of the basics of this but how is OpenAI using this for bigger features and bigger products. >> Totally. So actually we just published a blog post about this that I think could be cool for people to know about about how we used Codex to build Sora the Sora app for Android in 28 days and it immediately became the number one app in the app store. So you know four engineers 28 days number one app in the app store and it's not a trivial app that I was super impressed by the speed as I was watching this team go and uh this article has a bunch of like really practical advice for how to do it how to how to do so and um I think the you know if you so this is really written for professional software engineers building like big production apps like working in like complex code bases and um a really cool sort of headline to take away here is that with coding agents it doesn't get easier but you just move way faster and sort of the idea here is that you know the we didn't have four engineers just like purely vibe code this app in 28 days they didn't go in and just say hey codeex build the Sora Android app and have it work actually slight correction they did try that and it didn't work [laughter] it didn't go in one prompt and build the entire Sora Android app but instead what they did is they thought really hard about the architecture that they wanted the app to have. And they used a technique called planning, which I would say is just a super practical thing that you can do. So, let me see. I'm going to pull up uh the codeex codebase here, which is a slightly bigger codebase. And what I might do in order to do this is I might start a task here. Oh yes, sorry. One thing that I actually I wanted to share when you first install the Codex extension, it will appear here in the left and I highly recommend dragging it over to here. It's just a nice place for it to live. So there you go. >> News you can use. >> Yeah, in VS Code this easy IDE is like cursor. It is hard to find that. So I will let you explore where it is because it I feel like it even changes. But so I might say something like, hey, we want to make this like non-trivial change. Like for instance, we have a TypeScript SDK and maybe we want to write a Python SDK. >> Right? So that's I don't necessarily want a oneshot codeex on that. Although I could it might work. Uh so I might say something like this. Make a plan to build a you know Python SDK based off our TypeScript SDK. And this is a reasonable prompt. I could just send this. This would be fine. But actually, some of our power users at OpenAI have gotten fairly opinionated about how they like their plans to work, and we've actually published a blog post on really effective planning. So, Aaron posted a blog post about using plans.mmd and it's super easy to use this technique. Basically, what you do is you go to this blog post and you just copy this description. It's kind of like a meta plan. It's like, hey, when you plan, this is what a good plan looks like. >> Yep. >> So, for instance, a good plan is like self-contained. as a good plan has milestones and you know the agent should update the plan as it goes. So I have done so I have copied that into uh a markdown file plans.mmd. There you go. I just copy pasted that from the website. And so what I might actually do instead here is I might say using plans.mmd make a plan. >> Yep. >> Right. And so I might just send this prompt. Um this will take a while because the if you look at the spec for plans.mmd it's very thorough. And this is actually something that Codex is really good at. Like people love how thorough and like diligent codeex is. It's not the fastest tool out there, but it is the most thorough and like best at hard complex tasks. And so I actually, yeah, I could say, let's say, put it in temp.md. I'm asking it to put it in a random file. Uh, mostly because I did this ahead of time. So here is, uh, a the plan that it came up with. And so you can see it's about 120 lines that we could read through together. We see these todos that it wanted. Um, we see that it's identified the TypeScript naming conventions. This is great codeex thread, etc. like we actually are really intentional about how we name our SDK parameters. So, it's really important for me to read these and verify them, make sure that it didn't get that wrong. Um, it's making, you know, various decisions in here uh that I might be happy with. Okay, great. And so now what I can do is I could say I start chat and say implement the plan in SDK plan MD if I'm just happy with it. >> Yep. um and it would just go and this would this would take this is probably like a 30 minute to 1 hour task but I would be pretty confident in the results of this task. Um and that's how they built the sort of Android app as well. One very concrete recommendation is if you have a chat where Codeex is um producing these plans and you want to change something, it's actually really nice for the model if you just use the same chat to ask for changes to the plan and that way it has all this context in its head when it's ready to get going. First of all, I I love that you said that it has a head. So, we are the model has model has its brain. Yeah. I mean, we see this we see this a lot. This sort of like build a plan. Obviously, I love a spec. I love a purity. I love a technical design document. I'm curious just if we take take it the we take the Sora app example. I'm presuming that you had a plan of plans which is essentially like you look across the the architecture of an app and then you do kind of what we've always done in software engineering which is you spec out the full thing you want to do you break it down into components or initiatives that you can execute on and then where I think you're suggesting the velocity comes from is anyone engineer can do a detailed you know like technical spec and plan in in partner partnership with Codeex and then have Codex execute the kind of like V1 of that plan for review very quickly. And so you don't kind of get to bypass the architectural thinking of like how should this app be set up and what what capabilities do we want it to have and all that stuff. Although you can use AI as a brainstorming partner for that. Um but then once you have the kind of right-sized chunks of work and they can be pretty meaty. I mean like building an entire TypeScript SDK is not like a small initiative. It's not like adding a method to something. Um, then you can use this planning kind of uh planning strategy to then get what you're going to do all laid out and then have codecs executed. >> Yeah, I think that's I think that's like similar to how I think about it. So, I would say right now I I kind of like the terms vibe coding and vibe engineering to be honest. My sense is that right now you have a lot of agency in how you spend your time as a developer or you know as a product manager. I think when you're going to do something like the Sor you know build a production app like Sor app that you know you have to scale it's really important that you know maybe you have a bunch of like codec senior engineers but you want that like architect right or staff engineer think about the shape of the app. Um, and so that's critically important I think at the same time that so you know you're gonna have to think a lot about the shape of the app and you're gonna want to be really careful with review and we can actually talk about some of that how we've accelerated review at OpenAI which is kind of becoming you know now that we can write so much code like the bottlenecks are kind of like thinking about what code to write and then making sure that code is good reviewing it and landing it. I think at the other at the same time though Codex can be really powerful for those places where you just want to learn and you don't actually need like a scalable production ready app. So for instance we use codecs a lot for prototyping. The designers on Codex actually have a fully mostly vibecoded full prototype of like all the codec surfaces that they can just like design into with code and then we use that to play around and see if we like things and then if we do then we'll often vibe code like a branch in the actual product. So a lot of things are just tried by designers there and then you know sometimes the vibe code of prototype is like exactly like pretty close to what we want and so they'll just like land it with the help of an engineer uh or by themselves even and then sometimes we're like okay this direction was good or we we learned some stuff we iterated on the vibe coded prototype now we know what we want to build and then we can actually go and give that like really well- definfined spec to an engineer who might you know rethink some of the fundamental assumptions and so end up having to use codeex to rebuild a lot of it from scratch. So I think there's like two flavors of acceleration. I think there's massive acceleration on learning and then there's also massive acceleration on like executing >> execution. Yeah. This episode is brought to you by Graphite, the AI powered code [music] review platform helping engineering teams ship higher quality software faster. As developers adopt AI tools, code generation is [music] accelerating. But code review hasn't caught up. PRs are getting larger, noisier, and teams are spending more time blocked [music] on review than building. Graphite fixes this. Graphite brings all your code review essentials into [music] one streamlined workflow. Stacked diffs, a cleaner, more intuitive PR page, AI powered reviews, [music] and an automated merge queue. All designed to help you move through review cycles faster. Thousands of developers rely on graphite to move through review faster so you [music] can focus on building not waiting. Check it out at graphite dev.link/howi aai to get started. That's graphite dev.link/howi. So I I have to ask one question and then I do want to go to code review which is you know like it's sort of this you know when you know you know um but how do you decide between what needs a plan and what doesn't? to some extent it it it depends more about me than it depends about the task. So obviously the harder the task the more likely you want to have a spec. Um but I also think it kind of depends like what you're up to at that time. For instance like if I just want to get something done like quickly I might not have time to like wait for a plan and then go back and forth. So I might kind of throw throw codex at it but I might just do it four times in parallel instead. This is actually a thing we do like Codex we you can also use Codex um in the cloud so on web where it'll like run on its own computer and that has a feature called best event where it'll just like do the same task four times and so often like you can just have Codex explore uh instead of like exploring to do a plan and then you collaborate you just have it try four different attempts and find out what works best and you know I also do that with work trees locally as well. So I guess the the the better answer to your question is the harder the task uh the more you want to plan but the lazy answer to your question is uh also it depends if I have time to wait for a plan or not. >> I like that. I know one of the things that I have found myself doing which I think is really funny is as these you know longer running coding models come out 52 being among them I'm like waiting a lot more. I got to I I'm like trying to find ways to fill my time. And as somebody who used to have this like fancy executive job where like I really had a manager's schedule and then over the past two years I've been like builder life and now I'm like damn I'm back to manager schedule. Like I send the task off and somebody else, you know, quote unquote does it and then I got to find something to do with my time and I refuse to add more meetings to to my list. So um I'm with you. Do I have the time and patience for a plan? I mean, a lot of the a lot of the engineers on the Codex team >> will basically run two things that they're building in parallel, not more than two, like it's usually two. >> Yeah. >> Um, and so they'll kind of like be thinking about what to do on on one side and then and you by the way, this might just be like two different work trees and two different instances of their IDE open. It could be something like that. >> And uh they might just be thinking and collaborating with Codex in one while it's working in the other. And just juggling two seems to be manageable for sort of normal people. Uh juggling more than two seems quite hard for normal people. But my view on this from a product direction perspective is we don't really want to ask humans to juggle. Like that's not fun for many people. Well, some people like Starcraft in code, but uh we're training. >> Quick pause. I love Starcraft, which is why I feel like I'm really good [laughter] at all this right now. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um I think it's actually kind of it's kind of an apt analogy but it's not I didn't come up with it. I forget who did. Um but uh what we're trying to do is just make codecs faster and faster. >> Yeah. >> And we are also trying to basically set it up so that you don't have to do the waiting like as the models get smarter and smarter they can take on harder and harder tasks. Like I just heard from Naveen at every this morning who was sharing a demo of a bug that he no model could fix and then 5.2 2 came out um yesterday and um he threw 5.2 two at it and it thought for 37 minutes and was like this is the bug and then in fact that was the bug and he got the bug fixed right so as we have smarter and smarter models there is going to be more instances there are going to be more instances where you want to wait but I think that's our job as the product builders around the model to make it so that even when the model is thinking you're not waiting for it to think >> yeah or you know that you're waiting and you feel good about it I think that's one of the challenges I've had with with some of these where the thinking time as long is I find myself and blessed it's like when I you know worked with human software engineers I find myself being like how how's it go how's it how's it going you still you still on it like you still good and so I do think it's a really interesting product problem because there is you know useful latency in in these models um but as a product and designer being able to expose that latency and that reasoning and the progress in a way that makes people not feel antsy about it I think is still a challenge out there for for you all and for everybody else building these kinds of tools. You know, this was this has been super helpful on sort of like the basics of codeex. I would love to hear one or two integrations with other systems or tools that you found have been really like really multiply the impact you can get out of codeex. >> I think the biggest one by far is going to be GitHub and code review. Um, and then there are some others as well. This is just a nifty graph while I'm here about 5.2. to uh the model. Um well, let's take a quick digression. I'll show you because I just think it's super cool. Basically, what this graph shows is that uh 5.2 when you give it as long as it wants to think uh is an amazingly intelligent model at Sweetbench Pro, which is an eval of software engineering tasks. But the x-axis is pretty interesting. Basically, what it shows is the number of output tokens that the model took to perform these tasks. And so, it's kind of like how long did the model have to think? And when we say, \"Hey, you can think as long as you want ish.\" Uh, it's really smart. But the other cool thing is we're able to say, \"Hey, like we actually don't want you to think that hard or we want you to like kind of answer quickly.\" And so it's performing like even higher, you know, results than like say this previous model here, 51 thinking, but in significantly less time. And so this is kind of what we're trying to build going back to what we were saying about waiting, right? We want to just get you the same result much faster and then get you more intelligent results and, you know, then you give the model time. >> Yeah. get get the right result in the appropriate amount of time. Right. >> Yeah. >> Exactly. So, one thing you can do with codeex is uh you can ask it for code review. This is actually super easy to do but without uh integrating with GitHub. Uh we could just be in here. Let's just say that it it's written some code. Um I'm going to kind of ignore uh what what happened there. And I'm just going to pretend that I wanted to review this code. Uh so I could type slash review u and basically ask it to start reviewing his code. And this is something that people really love. And you know right now it does feel like when you put the model in a certain mindset like hey you are a reviewer and you give it a different conversation context than the model that wrote the code you know you'll just get like even better critiques than you might get from a human engineer partially because this model is not you know does has a lot of time to read all the code and like maybe even execute code to like validate those changes. So this is this is just something super useful that I I recommend doing and like many engineers on Codeex will like have Codex do work and then multiple times ask it to either review its code or critique its code or just make the code more elegant and that's just like a massive accelerant. So so let's say that you like this right and and your team has a practice of doing review something that you can go do is actually enable automated code review in GitHub. And so here when this PR was pushed, Codex automatically without anyone having to prompt it and without anyone having to have a computer running, this is just, you know, in the cloud, Codex went took a look and found an issue with the code. And the hit rate on these is is really high. Like we built this feature so that it only points out issues that it's like very confident or issues because you know the sort of the principle here is just like human attention is so scarce. We really want to protect it. But when it finds a really important issue, it'll post here and this is where you start to feel the AGI a little bit. It found this issue and then Ham basically replied like, \"Hey Codex, can you fix it?\" And then Codex went unfixed it, right? And so we can get into this kind of loop like that. So that would be my number one integration to give. The number two might be Slack and Linear. >> Well, I so I I love this flow and I think again um optimizing I'm actually running a 52 branch review right now. Um, I'm not running it in codeex, but I will do a comparison on the two experiences, but I'm doing a very much like compare this to base. Tell me what what we did what what what we did here. If there's anything I need to be aware of, I do like these in GitHub code reviews. I do feel like where I have found the highest quality is reducing noise in these. So, it's really great that you have kind of focused on confidence, focused on what what bugs really are going to matter and then this loop of kind of can can you fix it? And so, are you running this on kind of all your repos? Has this become like how code gets reviewed? >> Yeah, I mean Codex is is just everywhere at OpenAI, which has been really cool to see. You know, I feel like when I hear a story of of some tool being used everywhere, I'm always like a little skeptical. These people are biased. So the thing I can tell tell the audience here is that earlier this summer codeex was used by around half the company which is like I don't know a pretty low number right half. Um we're now at the point where um basically like all of technical staff nearly all of technical staff is using codecs constantly. And so it's funny because we don't even have this comparison point since everyone's using Codex. It's like hard to compare the people using Codex and the people not. But there was this period of time where we were seeing that like the people using codeex were like 70% more productive if you looked at PR volume. Obviously PR volume isn't like the best thing to measure but it's a thing you can look at. Um and now that metric doesn't mean anything anymore because everyone uses codeex. Codex code review itself is enabled on pretty much every single repo at the company and reviews like pretty much all PRs. Um, and you know, it's one of those features where we were a little bit nervous when we shipped it about how people would feel, but it was just an immediate hit and like people really like it. Uh, you know, maybe this is a bit of a segue, but you know, speak product person to product person, like something that we've been thinking about is if our mission is to deliver the benefits of AGI to all humanity. I believe one of the biggest limiting factors is like do people want to type the prompt or not? [laughter] You know, like I don't like typing. So, you know, I I would be too lazy to do this. And so, we were thinking a lot about like, okay, what are things we can do for teams that are just useful without anyone having to do any work? And so, we we tried a few things. Code Rio, as I showed you here, is one of the things we tried. Big hit. Um, we tried some other things that were pretty interesting, like we built a feature that would automatically attempt to revise um the PR when you know, you got a code review feedback from someone else. And uh you know maybe I' I'd be interested to try that again. But interestingly enough that feature was not super popular. The hit rate was like often like PR feedback. I mean sometimes it's nits but often it's like kind of in there. You need a lot of human context to understand that PR feedback. And so Codex wasn't acing it. And the sort of hit rate wasn't high enough to be worth the like email you get every time an event happens on GitHub. Whereas code review, you know, we were really careful with like how often it did things and we made sure, for instance, this is one where codeex didn't find any issues. It doesn't even notify you. It just thumbs up emotion, you know, you're done. >> Yeah. I I mean, I've had this experience too where it's it's interesting. I have also used automated code review and I have attempted that like full closed loop and I have also been dissatisfied with not just the the bug fixes. Sometimes they're fine, sometimes they're not. But I I often feel like putting a human in the loop that says, \"I'm pretty sure this is fine because XYZ or just remember we did this because ABC and sometimes there's a little context lost.\" But the other thing from a product perspective I think is interesting on these like proactive versus reactive agentic experiences is if you have a full agent loop, the human bar for quality is extremely high. And so dissatisfaction and frustration can bubble up very quickly. It's one thing if like your code review b you know bot says this is broken, you go fix it and then you get it reviewed again and it knits you. You're like okay I didn't do exactly what you wanted. But if you had the experience where like your code review bot you know raises something it fixes something and it knits itself that gets really annoying. >> Totally. And so I do again this is like a little bit of a aentic product design challenge that that we're now going to have that people I think need to pay attention to which is like how do you design for latency? How do you design for perceived quality and bars when humans are involved when they're not involved? And then one last thing I want to say to your comment which is I mean if if our human fingers are no longer valuable and used what role are we going to play like protect the typers [laughter] but um I I mean I get what you're saying which is almost all the friction right now in my product development software development flow is like literally writing the first prompt >> like sitting down >> and just going now let's like let's do the now and it's such a funny shift from where we've been before. >> Yeah. I mean it's it's interesting to think about right like you know obviously our mission is to just like massively accelerate every single developer and you know broadly that anyone who's doing anything where an agent using a computer can help. And so yeah the question of what our role is is interesting like I like to joke that the limiting factor is typing speed. I think that's half true. So like I think for things like review this code please the limiting factor is is typing speed. there's a lot of just like micro places where an agent could help you. Um, but then I think the other half is actually thinking, right? Like now that we can just have ubiquitous code and we can basically prototype things like trivially. The hard parts I think become like deciding what actually should make it in thinking like what a product should do like knowing a customer actually and then you know if you're building a complex system like being really thoughtful about like the architecture of that system and kind of curating the agent work. So >> yeah, >> you know, I think it's I talked to developers who are really motivated by like seeing people use what they build and I think those developers are increasingly just like thrilled, right? And then I also talk to developers who just love like the feeling of writing code. I I I don't know. I experience joy from both. And I think that's a place where, you know, we think constantly about like, okay, how do we make this feel as fun as possible? Uh, right? Like setting up dependencies kind of sucks, but you have to do that for your agent. So like how do we make that easy? Reviewing kind of sucks. So like how do we make that easy? >> Great. Well, just to recap because we've done a lot here so far before we get to lightning round. We have shown installing codecs as an extension, setting up tasks, setting up work trees, using plan and in particular the plan on how to plan on the openi blog to generate plans for more complex implementations especially when you need longer running tasks. Um and then automations around uh code review and bug fixes. The things we didn't call out but I think are really important are you can basically use codecs wherever you want. So we showed it in VS Code, we showed it in the terminal, you can get it on the web, you can get it in Slack, you can get it in linear, it can kick off in GitHub. Like I do love this idea of kind of like codeex anywhere is also really nice. So again, if you're intimidated by or don't understand VS Code, great. Kick it off in the web. If you love your command line tool, great. Let's use use a couple of those keyboard shortcuts that we showed. And so I just think this is a great kind of like starter flow that shows how flexible this platform is and how it can meet, you know, kind of like a bunch of people at a a variety of levels of tasks. So I'm actually going to start there with our lightning round questions, which is, you know, you just released um 52, you showed Bench. We're clearly, you know, like model wars every week. Um, I am really curious about harness wars. Like why does the interface to the model like codeex matter so much? And you know, we've seen a couple things that you've built into the platform, you know, PR review or code review, you know, little like small UX fixes that make make it easy to use, but like where do you feel like harness differentiates in your experience using these coding tools? >> I think there's two places. One is just the quality of model work and then the other is in the user experience. Right? So taking the quality of model work I I presume many people listening to this podcast you know tinker with models or have friends who are building models and like some people just are you know you they're model whisperers and they know they know how to use a model and some people are model whisperers for like a specific model but then maybe not for another model and one of the things that's I think very true is that these models are changing all the time right like we've been I've lost track I think we're shipping a new model like every two weeks recently at openi right and they're each model we ship is better than the last model. It's like super exciting. Um, but they're also evolving, right? They have new capabilities that are kind of hard to keep track of unless you spend all day on, you know, Twitterx. And so I think that there's kind of two things here. The first is like you need to know how to get the most out of the model. You need to know, for example, that open models, we kind of have this like very again agilled way that we train models. we kind of just give them access to a shell and we say like go and do whatever you think you should do in the shell. And so we see these like really interesting emerging behaviors where you know sometimes the model will decide to write a Python script to make many many edits to code and then we have debates about well is that a good idea or not? Like would we prefer it if the model was like plotting through the edits or do we like it running a script? But either way that's like a thing you should know. And so one of the cool things about Codeex is that we're building off harness in open source. And so you get to see the updates we're making for each model that we ship to make the most out of the model. And I can say like every time we ship a model, engineers from the Codex team will go like test it, think about it, talk to the research team. I mean it's they're it's just working super closely together to figure out how to make the most out of the model. And sometimes we we'll ship a new capability like model's getting better at parallel tool calling. Let's see how that works. or recently we shipped something called compaction where the model can basically where we can basically have the model like prep like start a new conversation with itself with a fresh context and what it'll do is just give itself just enough just the right information so that to the user it just feels like it's one conversation rather than like two conversations and so when we build features like that by building both the harness and the model together we can be much more opinionated about what to do with the model and then we can make the actual outcomes like way better for users. And so part of why the Codex CLI is open source is so that anyone who wants to get the best out of Codex models and actually just open models generally can just go observe our how it works. They can use the Codex SDK if they want and just like not even touch the harness just like delegate to us for that. Or if you want to build your own harness, you can just go copy paste parts of code. So we do this all the time. Like I'm in a bunch of like slack DMs with customers and we'll just send them point code pointers like oh yeah this is how we do this just like just copy this code please. So that's on the just like having higher quality model outputs but also keeping pace with the pace of innovation from our research team. That would be like why I think the codeex harness is awesome there. The other side is is um is product overhead. For instance, um earlier this year, most of the sort of like really powerful agentic flows that people were using like codecs and other were in the CLI, right? And this is super basic, but like I I I spoke to many people who don't really like spending all day in terminal. Like I love using the terminal, but I spoke to many people who don't. And I spoke to many people who really like seeing the code that is being edited at the same time. >> That's me. I'm I'm a co I'm a code reader. I like to read my code, >> right? And so, you know, that's a very very basic thing, but it's a place where just building the right product experience unlocked a ton of growth for us. And so, you know, empirically, I could say that we see many many more people who like looking at the code that's being written at the same time as the agent uh than we see like just like running in terminal like on the side. Um so uh I think you know that's a very basic example and then we were kind of touching on this point of like latency for a more advanced example like I think if we can harness the model right we can make it so that you can deploy the model to help you with like hundreds of thousands of things a day but without you having to type right but also without it being annoying to like filter these outputs and without you having to wait because whenever it's helping you with something proactively it's sort of doing so on its own computer and only letting you know when it has something great. So my view is actually that even as all these models are progressing if like let's just say that's stopped which it won't there are many years of product building to do to just like get the harness right and useful for people. Well, that's great. And I do want to make sure people did not miss this tip, which is if you're trying to figure out how to get the most out of out of these new models, you go go peek under the hood at at Codeex open source and just see what kind I mean, I think that's the other thing is what kinds of changes do you have to make when a new model comes out. Especially if you're a builder out there, maybe you're not building a coding tool, but you're building a SAS product that use these models when they come out. Being able to observe how the creators of the models actually maximize their unique strengths, I think is a really valuable thing that I think people really underestimate. Okay, my second question. I spied with my little eye. Atlas. Tell me your favorite Atlas use cases that you think people underappreciate. The first one is kind of boring but it's it's really really true which is I have started just asking chat for everything instead chat being chatbt. Um I just ask chat for everything uh because I get answers that are like really catered to me because I talk to chat about everything. You know I'm a weird person like if I ask a question and then um I like make a decision based off it. I tell it what decision I made because then it remembers. And so then the next question I answer I get is even better. And so just simply like my workflow for anything that's not code is I go to Atlas, I command T to open a new tab and then I just type whatever I want and I get an answer. And I often follow up like for me that's the sort of magic thing about using an LLM. Um so being able to just like ask your question and then follow up and then maybe navigate to links like super boring but but I love that. Um my other sort of favorite feature is u the fact is Sidhat. So basically any page you open should I show maybe I can show this. >> I think I should. >> Yeah. >> And while you're doing that I have to call out that you have settled a debate that I saw today on X which is like should you tell your AI when it's done something right or wrong after it's done it? Like once something's fixed a bug. I'm the person that's like great it looks awesome. Thanks that fixed. [laughter] But I do think that I in my mind I've convinced myself that closed loop creates some context that's like yes I did this particular thing right or wrong user has accepted it and that in some future world it's going to make my life better. >> Yeah. I mean so I think there's two reasons to do that. The first is just like memory. >> Yeah. >> Right. Like if you have memory enabled which most people do then you'll get a better answer. A very concrete example is I was on holiday and some plans changed. So we were deciding where to get dinner. Uh, and so we just asked chat for dinner recommendations. Uh, to be clear, we also we like food a lot, so we also like searched. Um, but it's interesting to get ask chat because it knew like where we were staying and it knew what food we'd had like the day before or whatever. And so it just gave like a really bespoke recommendation and that was cool. Uh, I think my other sort of hot take reason to do this is I think it's important to be polite to AI. I know this >> this is not an official company stance just to be clear but my sort of meta reason here is I just think it's important to be polite to everyone >> and I think that if you start not being polite to chat I think it can wear off on you and you just start not being polite to other people in your life and like we're adults like imagine kids right they hear us like talking to the rai in some way they're going to go treat someone who they you know they're children they don't know in some like not polite way so that's kind of my my hot thing like could not agree agree more. I, you know, I am a please, thank you, good job. And, and honestly, it's not because of the AI's humanity. It's to protect my own humanity, which is if I get used to being a jerk to anything humanlike, there is no way that does not bleed into how I think about people, speak to people, uh, clip this, pin it to the top of the YouTube channel, be polite for you if >> that, that resonates a lot. It's like our our humanity is defined by how we treat others, not how they treat us. Right. >> Exactly. >> So, side chat. So, basically, um I can go in here. I can click this button and I can ask questions about the page. Right. So, I could be like, \"What's great about GPT 5.2?\" Uh you might joke like and be like, \"Why are you asking AI to summarize this article?\" But like oftentimes I'll be at work and someone will send me a thing and be like, \"Thoughts?\" And I just like don't have time. thought [laughter] it's like what is this right and then you know and then I can have a conversation though right till then I can be like oh like interesting like you know >> um >> hey chat what do I think about this [laughter] >> I mean what that question is it often grounds itself in what I've talked to it about before it's like well since you are a person who likes you know like this you probably would be interested in this detail um so I mean this this is not maybe the best example because I'm asking for a summary but oftent times if I'm looking at like numbers or math >> or I need to learn more about like a concept, I'll use this. >> You can also use this to rewrite something. So if I was like, >> you know, in a Google doc, I could like select some text and like be like, hey, like how else might you rephrase this? So I think >> for me, side chat is is a really cool feature. >> Um, but >> I think I might be a bit nerd sniped by it to be honest in the sense that this is this is what I joined OpenAI to like help build. So I'm very interested in it. I'm like for me the idea of an agent that I don't have it it understands me I don't have to like map myself to its world >> is really powerful. So side chat is that codeex is that too right? You launch it in the codebase and it's in your environment. You don't have to go to it. >> Um I think this is the future and I'm like really excited for how we can just like take all the best ideas from Atlas and Codex and kind of bring them together into like a basically AGI super assistant. >> AGI super assistant. Maybe we'll see it next next year. It sounds like It sounds like the name of a product you would really [laughter] super assistant 5.1 >> 5.2 thinking high. >> Yeah. >> Um okay, last question. And we maybe already covered this, but um you we've established you are polite to AI, but when it is not replying, not doing what you want, not remembering, what is your prompting technique to get it back on track? Yeah. I mean, so first off, I have a bit of a weird job in that if I notice the EI not replying, I have to go probably file a bug or like start a SEV. Sev being like a word for an incident. So I, you know, yeah, I have to go do those things. But um I think context is everything. So if I see the agent not doing what I want, so I guess one really tactical tip is I I don't usually ask for things from the agent without asking for context, without giving context. So I'll say like hey I want you to like like change this UI from this to this so that you know users do this or like because we don't want people to be confused about XYZ and I often it's funny I think P like another hot take I think PMs are the best prompters um because we're used to not being the expert in what we're doing and we're used to not being the most intelligent person in the room right and so usually we can just like maybe suggest but we don't even know if that's right So I I I I sort of work with codeex in that way. I'll be like, \"Hey, can you like make this more elegant and I won't say what I want because I actually it'll look at the code and it'll know better than me.\" Um, so tip number one is give a lot of context and actually get really good at describing the level of ambiguity of your request. Like do not create false precision in your prompt if you don't actually care exactly about what what the outcome is. And then the second thing is like if that doesn't work and you explain why again and it still doesn't work then I just start a new chat. Um and you can do things the this is a very like advanced user thing that I don't think anyone listening to this will ever do but Codex is a very open product. It stores its conversations logs uh in like your home directory in acodex folder in a subfolder called sessions. So likeex sessions. So you could just go say like, \"Hey, I started a new session because you got confused. I wanted you to do this because of this. Go read your previous session to understand what's going on.\" And then and then like, you know, continue from there. >> I love it. Ending this episode with a hidden hot tip, which we didn't get to through our our Codeex walkthrough, which is all your all your sessions are stored locally, so just ask it ask it to go read them. This has been really fun. Alex, where can we find you? And other than reporting bugs, how can we be helpful? >> I am hiring PMs. So if you're interested, please uh apply on the job site and also hit me up on socials. Uh we are hiring generally a lot on codecs. We do love bug reports and we do love feedback and actually it's already an open source so I don't mind talking about it. We actually are also releasing a bunch of new configuration abilities for codecs like the ability to allow us commands or skills. So if you wanted to like help build Codex skills or like tell us what configuration you want, that would be very helpful. And lastly, just check it out. Codex is awesome. So uh you can find me uh on Twitter. I'm embarrass subreddit. We are there all the time and also love chatting there. >> Amazing. Well, thank you for joining How I AI. >> Cool.

    "transcript": "So many CEOs sending these memos. We want you to do 10 times more work using these magical tools. You go figure it out. >> I see a lot of CEOs fall to the delegation trap. They write the AI memo. They say, \"Hey, we're going to go do this.\" And then they don't do anything else. They ask their exec team, who ask a director on their team, who ask a manager on their team, who ask an IC on the team, and then that poor IC is like, \"Am I figuring this out for the whole company?\" It's like, \"Do you think that's going to go well for that person or for your or no, not really.\" And so I think it's really important for leaders to do hackathons, to do showand tells, whatever you want to call them, whatever you want to do, but you do need to provide a little bit of play space for the organization to get comfortable with it. And then once people put their hands on the tools, I find that some of the fear goes away. You've actually put these rubrics together that allow you to identify how do you build AI fluency as a PM at these different levels. And I think that exercise is so effective because people change around what gets rewarded and what gets measured. >> There is so many tasks that are not economically valuable right now. And these are the areas where AI and agents really thrive. Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have a very special episode with Wade Foster, co-founder [music] and CEO of Zapier. Wade's going to show us how CEOs can do more than send emails [music] to their teams about how they should adopt AI. Instead, he's going to pop open his screen and show us how he uses meeting notes, Zapier, and believe it or not, Grock to find, hire, and inspire talent across the company. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. [music] If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical [music] ways. Brex is bringing that same power to finance. BR is [music] the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance [music] stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. >> [music] >> Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the [music] US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi AI. Wade, thanks for joining how I AI. Why I am so excited to have you here is I think Zapier has done one of the most exceptional jobs. Not just leaning into adding AI into their product, but really thinking about how AI transforms a company and how people do work there. And today we have a really exciting show where we're going to show how you think about AI talent, AI fluency, interviewing for AI, and even finding some um AI pill talent out there that you can pull into the org. So before we get into it, why have you leaned in so hard into changing how your team works, who you hire, and what you reward inside the company? >> Couple reasons, I think. one for the same reason that everybody's doing it, which it feels like this is a transformative technology that allows us to ship and deliver just like a whole bunch more value to our customers. So that's first and foremost. Second, our product does a lot of this stuff and I would be embarrassed if we're out there evangelizing how this stuff can change how you work and internally we're doing none of it. And so when I talk to our team, I'm like, I want us to be on the forefront of using this stuff. And that should mean that we're going to try things and we're going to make mistakes. But even when we make mistakes, that's really good because we can now go out and share those mistakes and say, \"Hey, we tried this thing that everybody was, you know, talking was so great and, you know, either it was great for us or actually it didn't really work for us, like we couldn't figure it out.\" And I think that has helped people feel a little bit more comfortable, you know, just pushing on these things. It also helps that one of our core values is don't be a robot, build a robot. So like we're just we're probably just like more predisposed uh compared to most companies to to get into these things. >> Well, and one of the things that I hear a lot from people is they get a lot of anxiety sometimes when they're hearing these messages from their leaders about how they need to change how they do work or how they think about their job. and they say, \"I'm so busy. I don't have time or I just don't know where to get started. It doesn't practically apply.\" And where I've been able to crack kind of people is I think you are doing your teammates a huge service by investing in them getting these skills because every challenge the challenge I give to most people is I say okay let's say you've had a wonderful run at whatever company you're at and I know you're going to be here forever but maybe in a couple years you decide you're up for a new adventure. What do you think that interview is going to look like? What do you think they're going to scream for in two or three years? and do you think this is going to be part of how you're evaluated? And they almost consistently say absolutely yes. And then I say then you're very lucky to be at a company who wants you to be on the leading edge in terms of adopting these tools and technologies and processes in your work. So I think it's um not only the right thing to do for a business, but I actually think it's the right thing to do for employees and people as part of a team. >> I 100% agree. I see a lot of CEOs fall to like the delegation trap. They write the AI memo. They say, \"Hey, we're going to go do this.\" And then they don't do anything else. They they ask their exec team, who asks a director on their team, who ask a manager on their team, who ask an IC on the team. And then that poor IC is like, \"Am I figuring this out for the whole company?\" It's like, \"Do you think that's going to go well for that person or for your org?\" And it's like, \"No, not really.\" And so I think it's really important for leaders to do hackathons, to do showand tells, to do Friday afternoon, you know, mess around, whatever you want to call them, whatever you want to do. But you do need to provide a little bit of play space for the organization to get comfortable with it. And then once people put their hands on the tools, I find that some of the fear goes away. It's so natural because the media would have you believe that this stuff is terrifying. But for those of us who are messing around with it, you see how awesome it is, but you also see the flaws. You're like, \"Oh, it's not so good at this. It's really good at this. I'm going to lean into it over here, and then my role is actually doing these other tasks now.\" And so it becomes a lot more pragmatic versus this like boogeyman in the closet that's going to come for your job. >> I agree. And then the last thing I'll give you a little kudos on is you've made this very tangible for your team. So we have a lot of for example product managers in the how AI audience and you've actually put these rubrics together that allow you to identify how do you build AI fluency as a PM at these different levels. And I think that exercise is so effective because people chain around what gets rewarded and what gets measured. And by making it very specific, people can invest in specific skills and tools and know where, you know, the goalposts are. And so you've actually used AI to both like make those and make them better. And I think that's where we're going to start with our first workflow. >> So the first thing I want to show, we're going to talk about recruiting day. I spent a lot of time on recruiting. I've got this dock here which is you know probably most of your companies have like something like this which is you know like a values um document. Um most of them I don't think put like a ton of effort into it but I think it's really helpful when you start to have a document that's like written well for an AI to understand like what is good and bad behavior. I think you actually had an episode with um >> Hillary doing yeah Hillary like man that did a version of this where it was like >> you know uh default action. Okay. But what does that actually mean? Like here's examples of do this, not this. And it helps the AI sort of get really good at these types of things. So we had a document like this for forever that helps us with our rubrics. And so when you think about hiring somebody, you want to have clear evaluation criteria. Now, this we put together long long ago, but I have a hack for how you can do this even if you haven't thought about this. Um, and so the hack that I have for this one is if you use Granola, Granola launched this feature called recipes, which are just fancy prompts basically. >> And I did not think of this idea. This is something that was just in their library, which was genius. I've been using Granola for I don't most of the year, I think, almost a year now. And one of the prompts they have is, yeah, build the unspoken company culture. uh handbook. So you can see it actually starts to say how the organization works at least according to my meetings and I have it on in every single meeting so people really know at least how Wade works and the meetings in and around Wade works. Um and you get this like pretty rich example of what your company's doing. And so if you're using a tool like Granola, if you're using any of these meeting recorders, I think you can run a prompt like this to actually extract the real culture of the company. Uh, and so you can see what it rewards, you can see what it doesn't reward. Um, and it it it the first time I ran this, I was like I I was shocked. I was like, we spend a lot of time thinking about our culture, writing about our culture, and I think we do a better job than most. But as I read through it, I was like, \"Wow, this actually gets at the specifics in a way that even I hadn't figured out quite how to do.\" And so, I think this is kind of the magic of AI, especially if you're using a tool like Granola or something to collect data over long periods of time. Then AI gets really powerful because you can just like slap a prompt on the top of it and it can generate something like this that now becomes really practical for a whole host of reasons. You can now put it into job descriptions. You can now use it as part of hiring and firing. You can set expectations really well. So this is a tool I would use. I I would take the output of this now and I would go give it to a tool like chat GPT and say hey can you take this like unspoken culture and actually generate a set of like scoring prompts for how to evaluate somebody in an interview against these traits that um match zappier >> well and what I want to call out for the CEOs or other executives here are is you know a lot of CEOs talk about culture and our operating principles and how you know who we want to hire for and how we want to hire. But you do have this rich unstructured data. Most of us do just bunch of granola which is how your team actually speaks to each other and operates in the day-to-day and taking this this data and not using it for functional purposes. Although we've seen lots of functional purposes of this, taking sales calls and giving salespeople coaching, you know, taking product, you know, debates and turning them to documents, but actually taking the aggregate of all your company communications and stress testing it against your stated values is really interesting because then you can see well where are we aligned with our values? Where do things show up that we haven't actually clearly articulated that we want to reinforce and document and do all these things and like where are we actually off like we say we XYZ but then if we really look at how we speak to each other we do a lot of ABC and I just think so many CEOs again are like sending these memos like we want you to do 10 times more work using these magical tools um you go figure it out but aren't spending the time to figure out how to maybe even do the CEO job better. And I'm sure you think of yourself as the carrier of culture at your company. And so why not use these tools that weren't available before to do that? And then and then you can use, you know, AI to turn these into all sorts of assets as you said, job descriptions, um, performance rubrics, all hands content, all that kind of stuff that I think is really interesting. And we have, not to spoil it, we have an episode coming either before or after. We'll see when it gets scheduled with your EA Courtney who holds your executive team's feet to the fire on how they perform in meetings relative to your uh values. So it's not just about, you know, eye of Sauron from across the organization. You do turn it upon yourself as well. >> Yeah. I think so. So, I think what you're talking about is we have uh like coaching bots in a lot of meetings and stuff like this and I I love it honestly because I I as a CEO I want to get lots of feedback because of power dynamics and stuff. You don't always get like just the honest truth and AI is this infinitely patient coach and so it's just fantastic and be like hey here's some things I think you're doing great good job and like here's three things that candidly you're not doing a great job of you know you don't always have to agree with it but it's really helpful at just making me better at my job. Uh, and I think most people want that. Like most people want more feedback than your their their manager or their peers or whoever have time to give them. And AI has all the time in the world to give you feedback. >> Okay. So you have your um values document. You shown us how we could create maybe or infer some values from some sources of data that weren't available before. But then let's talk a little bit about hiring. So again, CEO job, carry carry values, culture, you know, drive pace in the organization, hire great people. So you spent a lot of time on hiring and how has AI come into how you manage some parts of the hiring process that were maybe a little bit more tedious or um harder to scale before? >> One of the places that I really like to use it is as like an assistant for interviews. So uh I again I use granola a lot. Um so I have built an agent that will help will will basically evaluate my transcripts and my notes and will help me make a yes no decision on how to hire this person. So what we're looking at here is Zapier agents. This is a pretty simple agent here. So you can see over here it triggers when there's a note added to a folder in granola. In this case if we look in it it's a interview agent. whenever it adds uh an interview to my new interviews um folder. And the way Zap year agents work is you can give them a set of instructions to follow. And so in this case, you know, the instructions are you're an expert hiring evaluator at Zapier. Your task is to review the interview transcript and notes provided by Granola. You're reviewing the job description provided at the knowledge source and Zapier's company values provided as a knowledge source to determine whether a candidate should advance in the hiring process. You want to evaluate the candidates's functional expertise, their values alignment, so on and so forth. So you run through all the things that you want this agent to do and then ultimately I give it a goal. And the goal here is, hey, I want you to recommend yes, no, or maybe to this candidate, and then I want you to provide your reasoning. Give me three to five sentences on why you think you should do what you uh why you are recommending this. Then I want you to go ahead and email me the uh evaluation. And inside Zapier agents, you can upload those knowledge sources. So you can see down here I have two Google Docs, the Zapier values rubric, and in this case, we're looking at a social media job description. So we're in the process of hiring someone to help out with our social, and so there's a job description uh associated with this. So this is a very simple agent now that for any uh of these interviews I'm doing with this, I will get in addition to my own opinion, I will get an AI opinion alongside of this. And I I I really like this because it acts as um like a bias check. It acts as a thought partner. You know, especially for me who's interviewing people across all sorts of disciplines, all sorts of areas. You know, I usually know a little bit about a lot of things, but it's nice to have another tool kind of gut-ing me on some of these things and giving me extra little tips and tricks and nuggets to go, \"Oh, that that that actually was interesting. I should pay more attention to that.\" So, um, we should actually see what this looks like for a candidate, but I want to do one thing real quick. So, let me show you how co-pilot works if you want to go change this. So, in this case, I actually just got off an interview with a candidate >> and I want to show the output of it, but I don't want to uh have any PII leak while we're demoing this. So, we're going to have chat uh we're going to have co-pilot get rid of that. So, um, let's say change the prompt to remove any identifiable information about the candidate. And so, the nice thing about how Zapier agents co-pilot works is it'll help you write these instructions. You don't have to sit down and write all these come up with all these instructions yourself. you can give it kind of just hey basic guidelines and then copilot will go generate all of that stuff for you uh and then you can just edit the the instructions directly if you if you want to. >> Yeah. And I'm going to go ahead and give I'm going to give your team's product folks or whoever design folks uh a lot of kudos because I use both co-pilot and a lot of the improve my prompt little mini features inside Zapier. And I also love how you score how strong some of my prompts are in some parts of the app. And so it is it is helpful just to have a co-pilot for prompting because no matter how much people say it's it doesn't matter. It definitely matters. >> Totally. Uh all righty. So it's made the change. I am going to go ahead. We're going to just I didn't actually check exactly what I did. So we're just going to do this vibe style. So you can see we've got uh interview evaluation for a senior social media specialist. Look, it's stripped out and that's nice. So recommendation for this candidate is yes. Hey, job well done candidate. Uh you know strong functional expertise all in alignment with Zapier's value. Uh they have a deep understanding of social media strategy particularly shift from product focused marketing to story building and community building. So you can see it kind of works through the job description then it works through the values here um and ultimately tries to like support the recommendation. Now, uh, one thing that I would do to make this better then is to look at the feedback here and go, okay, how can I update the prompt to give me even more actionable recommendations like if I felt like, you know, hey, this um, evaluator is like being too easy on candidates or too hard on candidates, I would um, basically go through the same system that Hillary shows off with her GPTs, which is like provide more suggestions, more details on this is a good answer, this is a bad answer. And over time, uh, you'll find that your, uh, interview agent starts to get really good at assessing candidates. >> So, I'm going to give you two enhancements that I think you should make. >> Oh, I love it. >> One is one that um, Zach Davis at Launch Darkly showed in his interview flow, which is he actually evaluates the quality of the interviewer during the session against the rubric. And so there could be a feedback for interviewer section at the end that says hey you actually forgot to ask about XYZ or when going into topic you didn't really reinforce this and so next time you interview remember to do ABC. We did this for um engineering interviews at launch because you know humans get into conversations and we forget exactly what we're going to ask and it becomes a very natural flow. So give yourself a interview coach in your feedback channel. The other thing is man, I just want that yes, no, maybe in the subject line. >> If you want like interview candidate, yes, move forward because the most important thing I say, you know, how I win good talent is I just I want to hire them harder than every than everybody else. That's one of my secret paths. So like the sooner you're like this is a yes, let's prioritize reading that. Let's get the candidate to the next stage. You can get um a little aggressive on talent acquisition. So those are my two pieces of feedback and we are seeing right here Wade is live using co-pilot to add those um suggestions into the overall prompt. And what I like about agents is I think this concept of agents has been very opaque to a lot of people in terms of like what can they even do? What does this mean? Do I have to like do these you know fancy flow connectors which are available um in your your product? But really what I say is just like if you were to explain to somebody how to do this job in steps and what they would need to get that job done. Write it down and that is that is the definition of your agent. And then these these AI tools can execute them. And then of course you know features like co-pilot or like enhance my prompt can then go make it a little bit more structured for how the AI models would read those instructions. But it's basically like just describe what you want to get done. >> Yeah. I think uh a a way I often describe it is if you've ever seen standard operating procedures, you've seen an agent. >> And you know, the folks that are great at writing standard operating procedures are fantastic at building agents. But even if you're not great at writing standard operating procedures, this is where Copilot helps you out so much because you can just blab in, can you do this thing for me? and it starts to go, okay, I get your idea, but here's what standard operating procedure for that should actually look like. And then it's awesome to, you know, sit down and talk to someone like Claire who goes, here's two other ideas to make this better. And then you can just go tell CPI to make it better. I find the real challenge with AI, at least at this point in time, is less about the tools and more about just coming up with ideas for like how do you make this stuff better? And once you have the ideas, it's crazy fast to implement it. Like those two suggestions took literally 60 seconds to add to this and they're great suggestions. >> Yeah. So how if you want them to know the Clarvo magic secret to suggestions on what your AI can do. One of the mistakes I see people make when they do agents is they think what do I do and let's just do what I do. And I say that's a great place to start what I do and how I do it. But then I say but then ask yourself if I had more time what would I do next? And what would I do after that? And if I had three interns on this, what would they do? And I say like pull that thread a little further along and imagine >> doing this task, you would do it to the nth degree and you would have maybe interns or additional resources and sort of infinite time to to take it to the next level. And I think Matt at Suzie showed us this on a very similar flow granola to a more structured workflows app where he said, \"Okay, if I had a sales call and my marketing team operated perfectly off that sales call, what are the 15 things that they would do? Not the three things they have capacity to do now, but the 15 things that we have great ideas for.\" And that can really open up your creativity for what what an agent can do for you. >> 100%. I think this is what's lost in the discussion is there is so many tasks that are not economically valuable right now because it's too expensive to pay a person to do that thing or it's too annoying and too tedious for a human to actually follow through consistently on those things. And these are the areas where AI and agents like really thrive because you can put something that will happily do that task for very low budget and do it very very consistently against those things. Um, and so there's so many tasks inside of a company that simply do not happen, even though they probably would if you could do it. Um, and so it's that that's where I think a lot of the value is. Um, not just in like, hey, do the stuff I already do. >> This episode is brought to you by Brex. [music] If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. [music] Brex is bringing that same power to finance. Rex is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the [music] background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issues, expenses are filed, and [music] fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account, and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the [music] US already runs on BS. You can too at bre.com/howi AI. Speaking of um what you would do if you had infinite time and capacity, I have an eagle eye on the the the rubric you just showed and it said that whoever runs your social media needs to be chronically online >> and you have figured out a way to use AI >> and probably one of our most chronically online model >> to identify talent. So, do you want to show us a little bit about your your trick that I have never literally never heard anybody say before on how to source some talent? >> So, uh one of the tools I like to use to help source um under the radar talent is Grock. Um >> you heard it here first. This is a how I AI first you all. >> Okay. So, uh what we are looking for here is we're trying to find some good social media uh candidates. And so let's say help me find uh posters on X that are fans of Zapier, no code, agent building, automation and related topics. Uh, I want posters that share tutorials and education related ideas, you know. Um, let's see. Uh, what else do we want? Um, these posters should have modest followings. Um, not too much, but not too little. Um, I'm looking for diamonds in the rough. Let's see. Uh, what else might we want? Uh, let's say we're on a budget. So, um, we're on a budget, so look for folks outside the Bay Area. We don't want Zuck to get his hands on these people. Um let's um you know g give me let's just say like give me 10 ideas. So we'll just start with this uh and see what comes up with here. Um I will like when we're looking for folks I will do this um to just do tons of revs for it because sourcing candidates is crazy times like you have recruiters like they do this stuff all the time. Um but they all love LinkedIn and they use like LinkedIn stuff. I find Grock like helps you find just a different slice of the market that people are not looking for. And because you can ask it um through natural language, you can do these kind of odd searches that are like really hard to do in kind of like LinkedIn's like boolean search um tools. Uh and so you end up finding people that you're like, \"Oh, it's kind of interesting.\" And it's great for other stuff, too. Like if you're looking for um like a lot of folks do uh influencer marketing these days. Well, if you want like this would be a very simple way for me to source uh potential like folks to do influencer marketing or you know if I wanted to find people who just might have product feedback for me. Say you're like a new startup and you want to go find people who have a certain problem you could do the same way. So um you know Grock is like a people finder uh is a really helpful tool. Um, all right. So, you can see here we've got a handful of um folks that they sent over. So, you've got automation king uh who's sharing tutorials. You've got uh uh Ritz talks. Um we've got a lot of folks from India, Nigeria, etc. So, there must be like a hot bed of um no code talent going on in there. Interesting. So, you could click through to these and you know start to check out uh different profiles here. Actually, I'm not sharing I'm sharing just a tab. Let's just hover and see what we get here. Um, all right. That's kind of interesting. Um, a thousand day challenge. That's kind of interesting. Um, someone's maybe like building out like a whole education curriculum. Um, so that's interesting. We've got one here that's um, uh, I don't know, that's like kind of pretty standard, I feel like. Uh, interesting. See, a lot of the one challenge you have with this is you start to find folks who like I can't always tell if they're bots or that's the one challenge with the Gro stuff. >> Not a bot. >> I know, right? So, let's say let's do not a bot. And uh let's say uh give me people with real faces as >> avatars. Um >> is that what they're called? >> For profile for profile. >> Avatar would be not a ring. >> Yeah. And let's do let's just do um we only let's say we only hire in the United States. So let's do United States located folks. Um give me uh you know 10 more ideas >> or something like that. So you can kind of just do this back and forth with Grock and you'll just find like like we're looking for diamonds in the rough here. So it's not that they're all winners. Um it's just to help you unsurface folks that you may never come across um otherwise. Well, and what's interesting about what I was thinking as it gave you this list is, you know, maybe not all those candidates would be great, but as you said, there must be something no code happening in Bangalore, like should we do more community events there? Like could these be so so it can give you ideas of kind of sub sub segments of your market that maybe maybe not for an employment perspective, but maybe for a customer engagement, community engagement perspective could be really great. Now, let's see. Here's interesting. This one didn't do a good job on the, you know, only 16 followers. That's tricky to learn tricky. >> You need to say it cannot have numbers more than two digits in their username. >> Cuz that's the trick. >> There you go. Um, here's a couple that look pretty good, though. Uh, I liked I liked Nathan. Nathan seems kind of interesting. So, you know, again, with recruiting, it's an interesting The thing I tell my team is there's there's no there's no shortcuts in recruiting is what it boils down to. It really is a numbers game. And so, you're just trying to like increase the surface area of your ability to find interesting, talented people. Uh, and you kind of just got to sift through a lot of lot of stuff to find them uh at the end of the day. So, um, Brock, also, by the way, we're looking at just X posts, but you can ask it. um you know how uh how about finding you know 10 YouTubers um so you can do kind of the same thing and YouTubers might actually be a better fit for us because these people are posting content and videos. So um you know you can do that as well. Uh, so I do like it for um yeah, finding finding diamonds in the rough. >> And so why Grock? Not just because you have this access to X, which is just a different slice of the market than something like um LinkedIn or or even like parsing YouTube, but also because it has this like pretty broad um sources of data that it can pull in. I also love the reasoning we just saw here, which is Grock got frustrated. Oh goodness. >> Okay, here is here are promising YouTubers. Interesting. >> So, there we go. Uh, Zapier's Brigade Guide 2025. Like, oh, that's nice. Somebody built that. I like that. I'd have to go the The thing that's annoying is it gives me their their X profile, but what I really want to go see is the YouTube channel. So, I go back and say like, \"Hey, can you include the YouTube handle uh channel link in the um table here?\" Um, Doc Williams, I happen to know this guy is quite good. So that's that's a nice find. Um we got a competitor in here. So that's interesting. >> They're probably not gonna go there. Uh yeah. So I don't know. It's uh I think it I don't see a lot of people using Grock in this way. So uh I think it is an interesting tool to share. It is especially helpful >> for >> communities that are heavily on Gro. Um yeah, >> like another area we've used it before in the past is finding >> um technical AI talent because there a lot of discussion about AI happens on um X >> and so it is really helpful at surfacing those folks. >> Well, this was our first I think our first Grock walkthrough on how I AI and I did not expect it to be around recruiting. So a very very first for for our show and thanks for showing it. So just to recap what we looked at today, we saw your meetings to values workflow via granola. We also talked a little bit about how you have sort of always feedback and coaching even for yourself as a CEO. We looked at a Zapier agent for giving interview feedback to make yes or no hiring, you know, kind of early calls and give you some meta analysis on your interview style. And then we are going to find terminally online YouTubers to she'll know on the internet via Grock. So this was a end to end how to AI native CEO endto end how to do recruiting and hiring and culture values alignment with AI. I'm going to do a couple lightning round questions and then we are going to get you out of here. So the first one that I have to ask is this has been a lot around talent and the conversation on AI has been a lot of like what roles are changing, what roles are going away and what roles are durable and you just said something which is a lot of tasks that were just not economically viable for companies now can get done and I think that's a whole set of work that can get done in an organization but you're still hunting for talent. So I have to ask you what roles you still feel are like highly competitive uh right now even in the middle of all this AI transformation. >> So we're insatiable for engineering talent engineering engineering leadership like that we're hiring very very consistently. >> There's an interesting way you phrase the question though which was um >> where is there still demand for top talent? And I think the answer is for top talent everywhere. everywhere. >> Everywhere where I see question marks is very hyper specialized roles that focus on a very particular task where that task is now almost entirely done by AI. So you think like your classic like analyst roles where it's like hey I'm going to go uh do like competitive research on a bunch of it's like that's a prompt now. Uh and so there are ways in which you can elevate that job. You can build agents that help orchestrate this stuff and then you can sort of redeploy yourself in other areas. And so I look at most knowledge work and say hey there is a version of your job that can be elevated and allow you to have much much higher impact but it requires you to invest in the tools and requires you to learn these things. And the places I worry most are in organizations that have fleets of these people doing these jobs. That's the place that's really tough because you definitely don't need fleets of those folks anymore. And so that's where I feel like, you know, if you're in that situation, you got to find a way to elevate yourself. Um because that's going to be tough. Um but most most jobs I feel like there is like top talent. I I I need top designers. I need top recruiters. I need top PMs. I need top marketers. I need top sales reps. Like all of these things, I'm not done hiring them. Um, it's just what it means to be top has has changed quite a bit. >> Yeah, I completely agree. And what I like about what you're doing inside the company is you've just leaned in to not only hiring people who fit this new profile, but again, as we talked about at the beginning, investing in time and development for your team to build these skills. And so I'm curious as someone who has leaned in very hard and probably changed how a lot of people do their job probably by by practical nature of how your product has evolved over the past two years and allowed them to do their job little very differently. How has that changed the company if if at all? What feels different? What feels the same? >> You know there like there's feedback bots everywhere. So you're like constantly getting coaching and feedback on things. Um, you know, we've always had a lot of automation, so that doesn't feel all that new. Like our Slack is pretty unhinged with like, um, you know, emoji reactions trigger all sorts of stuff. Um, and it's not too uncommon of a scenario inside of Zapier for like a new person to come in and like, \"Oh, that's a cool emoji. I'll react with this.\" And not realize that like that is actually attached to something. And they'll they'll, you know, trigger a suite of automations. Most of the time it's like pretty benign stuff. Uh, and so it mostly gets a chuckle. It's not hooked up to anything like crazy critical. Um, but that has always been the case inside of Zavier. Um, you know, I think the the next chapter for us where I see opportunity is how do we start to like break down more of these silos? We've already started doing this in parts of parts of the organization, but this feels like one of the harder culture tasks where you're taking, you know, two job families and saying, \"Actually, these need to become one now.\" And um we're starting to see that in pockets. Uh you know, I wouldn't sit up here and say like, you know, there's uh you know, we we only have builders now. There's no such thing as like a product manager, a designer, an engineer. We're not that far. Um I I think, you know, some of that stuff feels a little overstated in 2025, but in 2030, >> I don't know. I I famously said it in 2023, so I'm just waiting for it to become true. I'm just either I get to every year I get to say I'm wrong for now, but as soon as it happens, I'm going to say, \"Look, look at me. I have I have the receipts.\" >> I think you're directionally correct. It's the time horizon that's tricking. >> Horizon. Exactly. That's exactly right. Well, okay. My last question I ask everybody. You seem like a really nice person, but when AI is just not giving you what you want, when Grock is being sassy, what is your prompting strategy? How do you handle it? How do you deal? >> Yeah. I I basically have two bows. One is like pretty pleasant, you know, hey, please do this, please do that, thank you, etc., and then if I'm really really not getting it, I get pretty curt, no, try again. No, do this different. Uh, so that that's my my go-to. >> Good. Do you um do you feel like any of those strategies actually work in prompting zap your agents? Like I see a lot of markdown. Should we put all caps in there? Should we say I'll give you a dollar if you do this right in in our agent prompt? Have you tested any of that? >> I I I have. I can't tell if it makes a difference or not. I I think it doesn't. >> I think how we how we prompt is more of a reflection of us than it is of our AI overlords. Well, Wade, this has been fabulous. Where can I know a little bit of where we can find you, but where can we find you and then how can we be helpful to you? >> Yeah. Uh I am, you know, Wade Foster on X on LinkedIn. Uh you should check out Zappier. check out Zapper agents. Like agents are a way different way to build automations than folks maybe are familiar with with Zapier. Uh so definitely check those out. And uh you know if you're I mean shoot you're watching how I AI like you want to work at a company that's AI pilled so to say like check out we're hiring top talent everywhere. So we'd love to have you build crazy stuff inside of Zap here. >> Well thanks for joining us. I appreciate it. >> Love it. Thanks Claire. >> Thanks so much for watching.

    "transcript": "So, you've built yourself an AI chief of staff. >> The AI chief of staff is actually something that I have been trying to build since I started vibe coding. There's a lot of repetitive things that I have to do. For example, like prepping for podcasts and speaking engagements and stuff like that. And so, I've built out an agent that preps me. >> Let's go into a specific workflow of how this chief of staff actually helps you with do something. And I think you did a little prep for this podcast. >> I basically prompted and said, \"Hey, let's generate a how AI flow.\" And so I was trying to get it to tell me what should I actually demo that is going to be part of this chief of staff app. And then what actually ends up getting output is this. It gives me an executive summary. Here are three different ways you could tell me about yourself and web flow. >> Just the ability to be prepped even in a few minutes ahead of these things can really make your life better. [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today's episode is all about the AI native executive. We have Rachel Woolen, CPO at Webflow, who's going to show us how she uses AI, cla [music] day using AI as an executive. She's also going to show us her formula for teaching teams how to use AI, drive adoption, and get them in those new tools with excitement. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Graphite, the AI powered code review platform helping engineering teams ship higher quality software faster. As developers adopt AI tools, code generation [music] is accelerating. But code review hasn't caught up. PRs are getting larger, noisier, and teams are spending more time blocked on review than building. Graphite [music] fixes this. Graphite brings all your code review essentials into one streamlined workflow. Stacked diffs, a cleaner, more intuitive PR page, AI powered reviews, [music] and an automated merge queue. All designed to help you move through review cycles faster. [music] Thousands of developers rely on Graphite to move through review faster so you [music] can focus on building, not waiting. Check it out at graphite dev.link/howi ai to get started. That's graphite.link/howi aai. Rachel, welcome to how I AI. The reason why we are doing this podcast together is we were sitting at a very recent San Francisco based AI event and we were talking about how so much of the discourse is around the AI native PM the AI native engineer basically like the AI native IC and we spent a lot of time on that topic here at how I AI but you and I have been chief product officers and we want to talk about the AI native executive and I think your workflow and the tools that you have built yourself are such a great example of somebody with, you know, as I say, a very fancy se-level title who is actually leaning into not only getting hands-on with these tools, but building things that help them do their job better with AI. So, how did you get here? Because I will tell you, not every executive is as into this as maybe you and I are. So, what kind of clicked in your mind to get you thinking like my job's going to change. I really got to figure this stuff out. >> I started coding when I was 16 and, you know, it's obviously been kind of a lifelong journey of building and tinkering and, you know, making mistakes. And so, I I feel like I I kind of built that resiliency pretty early in life. And now, uh, in my my current role, you know, I probably hadn't coded in about, you know, six or seven years. And then when all of the new appgen tools came out, I think lovable is like one year old now, um I was like, \"Hey, I'm going to try this out.\" And you know, it was it felt magical, right? And I'd kind of played around with some of the earlier versions of GPT. Uh but you know when it was so when kind of like vibe coding started coming on the scene I actually built an app uh to capture my kids memories and that was the first vibe coded app that I built and I built it in a weekend and it was it just felt like something completely different than anything I had ever built before. And you know here we are a year later and this is you know now I'm like sitting in clawed code all day and I you know this is an app that I kind of like I'm continually maintaining. You can see I'm running it on local host and you know I've probably have built dozens of apps this year. We just launched our appg gen product. So I feel like a lot of times when you're building AI native products you also have to be just in the weeds a lot and making mistakes. And I'll show you like this product is not perfect. This is a product for one person right now. And so that's that's really you know kind of how I got started. And I think it's it's something that now is just part of my day-to-day. This is how this is my daily driver. >> This is a story I hear a lot. It mirrors my own story. This is probably why you and I get along so well, which is, you know, started coding very early, a lot of self-taught stuff, and then, you know, get into these jobs where coding hands- on keyboard wasn't my job. And then in 2023, 2024, it just became easier to go 0ero to one on stuff. It wasn't that I didn't have technical skills. It was just I didn't have time to do things. And so the ability to, you know, do AI assisted engineering or vibe coding was it just brought me back to the love of coding and building things. And so I hear that a lot. I certainly feel that a lot. The second thing I hear a lot that I tell people who are like trying to motivate themselves to learn some AI skills is find something personal to work on. you said like this memory app for your kids and do it in a weekend. You will get hooked. I think these vibe coding platforms are some of the most addictive games on the market right now. And so again, you don't have to start with something at work. You can start with something that's personal. And I think once you get hands-on and realize what's possible, it's hard to think that your day-to-day job is going to be the same. So, let's get into what you built because I feel like I need this. So, you've built yourself an AI chief of staff. Tell us more and how you're using it in your everyday life. >> Yeah, so the AI chief of staff is actually something that I have been trying to build since I started vibe coding. This is actually the first app that I tried and then it didn't work the first time that I tried it and then I've just been kind of continually trying to build it. And what you'll see here is like kind of rotating uh agents. I've just kind of been, you know, ticking away different use cases. And then a big part of this is also, you know, I I really want to help my team level up. And so it it would be inauthentic for me to tell them, hey, you need to prototype with AI if this isn't something that I'm doing every single day. >> I completely agree. And one of the things I want to call out about how you're talking about building this software is one, you're building it for an N of one. You're building it for yourself, so it can be really hyper customized. two, you're building sort of a a multimodal interface to this in which it can be a web app or it could be something just like a little bit more close to the metal in terms of in the terminal or in cursor. And then I love this idea of being able to build ephemeral widgets that are useful that you can just toss away. Like you may never look at this Q4 road map after Q4 again and you may want to do it completely differently the next time. you can build these like little personal ephemeral apps and then toss them away when they're not useful to you. And so I think software has become as accessible as documents have if you can lean into some of these tools. And so let's go into a specific workflow of how this chief of staff actually helps you with do something. I think you did a little prep for this podcast. I >> did. So I will actually run different terminals that are all running Claude. I do this partially because, you know, I I want to make sure that I'm like not using too much context and then I find that when I when I'm asking questions that are of a similar ilk, I get better answers back um in that same terminal window. But I basically prompted and said, \"Hey, let's generate um a how AI flow.\" And so I was trying to get it to tell me like what should I actually demo that is going to be part of this chief of staff app, right? So it knows this structure and then what actually ends up getting output is this. So this is it gives me like an executive summary. You know if we were to vamp it would be like hey here are three different ways you could tell tell me about yourself and web flow. >> I just love that you can do this on an ad hoc basis get a structured output feel very prepared. I don't know if you're like me and don't don't tell my my teams that work for me. I am a just in time executive which means like the 2 seconds before I'm walking into a meeting that's the time I have to prep for that meeting with very rare exceptions because you are just back to back to back to backto back things. I I say sometimes to people the number one skill you need to learn as an executive is improv because you are just dropped into a wide variety of context. you need to be able to think on your toes. And so just the abil I had a chief of staff and just the ability to be prepped even in a few minutes ahead of these things can really make your life better. So let's go through >> Okay, this is a very specific example. It's sort of our meta example. >> Yeah. >> On how we're going to go through the show, but let's talk about your morning triage and how you start your day every day using this AI chief of staff. >> That sounds good. So in this case, what I actually gave it was a question. I said, \"Hey, how can I make my week, my last week better? What what could I have done?\" Because I I think that I don't have a chief of staff anymore. I used to have a chief of staff at another company. And so I knew that this was something that they would be like kind of combing through my calendar and like, \"Hey, you're not blocking your energy, right? Um and you're you're not like kind of taking care of yourself.\" And so, you know, the other the the main thing that they kind of called called me out on, which I thought was really funny. Um, so we just had our customer conference about a month and a half ago, and you know, I haven't taken quite as many customer calls. And it's basically calling me out and saying, you know what, you're not spending enough time with customers, and that's where you get energy from. And so, it's basically like doing a time analysis on my external calls. I'm like, how is that possible? And again, it did pick up. it wasn't like 100% correct. And so I think that but but it was kind of like a signal to me. I'm like, \"Oh, this is a place where I need to go and like reinvest, right?\" And it's like, \"You're a CPO with like no regular visible cause for contact. Fatal flaw.\" And I'm like, \"Oh gosh.\" Um, it's very like dramatic, right? Uh, >> well, how does this actually access your calendar? How have you technically built? >> Good question. Um, so I went and I got a token from Google Cloud and I basically I'm not going to show it, but I I basically have it like in my uhv file and so but I didn't really like set that up myself. I mean I knew that this was the way that I was going to need to construct it because I had built other apps before. But let's see if I can find it. So this is like myv file. I'm not going to show it to you because I'll have to like burn all the the tokens I have in there. but it's basically has a bunch of variables and so one of those variables is my Gmail. Um, and then it walks you through how to actually go and set that up. One of those variables is my uh Google calendar. And you know, then I give it certain authorizations. So in the case with Google calendar, it can only read my calendar. In the case with Gmail, it can only create drafts. It can read, it can uh archive, and it can create drafts and label. And so a lot of this is like thinking about how do I, you know, put the right guardrails in place. It's kind of like thinking about software, right? How do I put the right guardrails in place so that I don't make mistakes or the agent doesn't make mistakes? Um it's kind of janky software, right? Because I I mean I because I'm like, \"Oh, this is like pretty powerful.\" And then a lot of times I'll like go and kind of take some of the power away um when I realize I've given it like too much uh you know too much authority to act on my behalf. And so I think that's you know part of it is also like me populating my own you know kind of intuition about what feels good in working with agents um and what feels like it's kind of like overstepping. >> Yep. And so, are you coming to this every morning? And this is sort of a metaanalysis of your calendar, which again, I've had a chief of staff we did every Friday where we're like, what what are you doing, girl? Like, let's let's fix this. But tell me how you would use this on a daily basis. >> So, tell me about my day tomorrow. What can I delegate? And so, this will run for a couple of minutes. And when it comes back, it'll tell me this is what's coming up tomorrow. uh this is what I think you can actually you can do something else. This is you know I think the the way that I would like to make this smarter is this is who you should delegate to and then you know I'm still kind of working on my my Slack agent so I I can't show you but what I want to do is basically like send notes to my admin and be like hey could we go do this >> and is this fetching the calendar events through an MCP? Is it is it some custom code that you wrote? This is fetching it through an API token. >> Um, I don't think that there's an MCP that is like a a >> official >> official MCP. But what you can kind of see, this is why sometimes I like looking at my briefing. So, other things that I do here, you know, I actually have like a little um, you know, like a little like note card that I like to make for myself. I'm like, I did prep for you. That's good. And then, you know, I'm basically kind of looking at this. It the thing that I like about it is it like makes it just very easy for me to get a snapshot and and view it, but I'm still kind of like iterating on what do I want this um to be like. >> Let's just take a pause really quickly on your web app while this is running in the background. And what I love about what you've designed is look, we're all running on Google Calendar or whatever, but you want it to look a certain way. You want it to be designed a specific way. You want to have a Can you show us that little note card really quickly? >> I I got this idea from Mark and Dreason about like what are my top priorities for the day and then did I actually accomplish it? and hold your horses real quick. It's also extremely cute. So, for people that are not on YouTube and are listening, it is actually designed like a blue lined note card and it does this little flip. Look at you product person. I I mean, this is one of those other things where when people talk about personalized software, they don't get to talk about the little like pieces of that you get to put in the app that just make you really happy. Okay. So, sorry. Sidecar on design. So, you have your top priorities. >> Yeah. I I just as a side note, like I almost redesigned the app last night because I was like, I wish it kind of felt more like Apple Notes. And I think that's like part of what is fun is like, okay, what would that actually be like if I translated this app and I had like a theme for it? And so, there's something there's something really fun about like actually getting to design again, but not actually I mean, it takes the amount of time. It's not it's it's not at like the pixel level perfection of the incredible designers on my team, but it does at least convey like you know there there's a certain um Jennaqua of this like app that I'm trying to to capture to make myself happy. >> Yeah, I love it. It's so great. Um okay, >> so here we go. Here we go. >> Yep. >> Okay. >> Your your chief staff is very mean. I tell it to be mean to me. That's why [laughter] I want it to like keep me in line. You know, I'm I'm one of those people who likes to try to take on too much, I think, sometimes. Um, okay. So, it's basically telling me to make certain meetings async. That's a great idea. It's telling me to delegate a couple of these. This is also probably a great idea. I don't think I can delegate this one, but good call. Um, it's telling me there's too much clutter on my calendar. This is one of those things where somebody's just like, \"Put something in my calendar. I don't know this person.\" Um, so that's definitely optional and I haven't accepted. And then it's like, can whatever director cover this and send me a summary. Can Right. And this is really helpful. This is like forcing me to think about, okay, do I actually need to attend all these things that I've signed up for? And can I give myself a break during the day to do some work and, you know, maybe get home to my family at like a reasonable hour? I love these delegation messages because just as a human, it is very easy to identify meetings that you don't need to go to and then you're like, \"Oh god, how do I say I don't want to go to this meeting?\" [laughter] So even getting that draft where you could just find I could just copy paste that into Slack is such a useful friction reducer in managing your own time. And again, we're talking about the AI native exec just too busy, over booked, under prepped, really just wanting to spend our time vibe coding if we're being honest. So, I think this is really, really useful. And again, I I like this because it's very conversational as a chief of staff might be and really helps you sort of figure out what you can do with your calendar. And then I like how it's mean to you. What's the brutal truth? Let's look >> truth. Is that [laughter] I'm like, yep. >> It's because being a senior PM sometimes sounds more fun than >> I know. I'm like, is that bad? Is that a bad thing? Um, [laughter] >> so for those again who are not watching, the brutal truth is you're operating as a senior PM, not a CPO. You're reviewing PRDs, approving scripts, and recording marketing videos. I mean, they're calling a spade a spade. >> This is the behind the curtain stuff. And I tell everybody this about the origin story of chat purity, which is they're like, \"Why did you build chat purity?\" And I was like, \"Man, because no matter how fancy of a title I got, I still was writing PRDs all the time.\" And so >> this is this is really really great. And then I love this idea of like the only thing that will matter in six months are is this conversation. What an amazing way to level up. So, chiefs of staff that are watching here, you need to end every meeting with your exec with the brutal truth. Um, and and build this for yourself. Okay. So, this gives you a really good prep for your day. I'm presuming you do a very similar workflow for email as well. What is outstanding? Can you just walk us through maybe just some of the problems that your email um chief of staff solves? Yeah, I mean I think that my biggest problem is that I'm I have like five I'm like 500 emails deep in my email, but it's basically archiving a bunch of stuff that I don't need um to it's keeping a few things in the inbox and then it's drafting a few responses and you know a lot of this is like I've been kind of like continually updating this particular agent to know where to draft responses. Um, sometimes it draft responses, you know, like some random SDR inbounds to me and I'm like, \"No, no, no. You don't need to like draft responses to this person, but a lot of times it'll be like, you know, somebody from like a like a partnership type of email will send me an email and it'll tell me, hey, you need to pay attention to this email.\" So, a lot of it is like trying to also know like when somebody's waiting on me and asking for some document to get shared, right? And so, you know, this is like kind of a cursor view. and then I can go through my inbox like very very quickly. Um I'm I think the Slack version of this is going to be like an absolute game changer since we operate almost internally in Slack 100%. Um but that one has been a lot harder to digest even with like the where the models are at. It's like almost too much data to triage. >> Yeah. >> Um so I I feel like that's like my next that's my next hill to climb. What does that say about what we expect of humans? That we are expected to triage a vast amount of very disperate information with a lot of disconnected context. So disconnected that fancy pants large language models cannot make sense of it. But for some reason, us with our meat brains are expected to be able to do this. And I just think that is such an indictment of how we're expected to navigate the massive amounts of information as as people that are working on teams in these asynchronous or semi-synchronous ways. Yeah, it I mean I think it's also become so different during you know like post pandemic and especially if you're working for a remote organization and you know I I think that that you know that we're obviously only what you know four years five years into that experiment and so I think that we haven't like the tools haven't quite caught up with what we need to kind of declutter our our brains um in through that kind of transition. And so I I still think we're in like the early days of of how to effectively do remote work, but that's like a different topic for another podcast. >> The early story of Atlassian is probably very similar to your own. At Lassian knows firsthand the challenges that startups [music] face every day and that the right tools are essential to go from MVP to IPO. That's why Atlassian [music] for startups gives eligible companies up to 50 seats free on the premium edition for products like Jira, Confluence, Loom, Jira [music] product discovery, Compass, and Bitbucket. So your team can use the best-in-class tools to plan, track, and collaborate on work, whatever that work might be. Many of today's most [music] successful startups like Cloudflare, Canva, and Rivian relied on Atlassian [music] for their growth trajectory. And Atlassian wants to give that same opportunity to the next generation [music] of builders. They know how important it is to focus on building the right things [music] early. Whether you're in the sticky note stage or well on your journey, teams [music] at any stage can work smarter together. It's never too early to start with Atlassian. Head to atassian.com/startups/howi for more details and eligibility. Okay, I want to do one more fun chief of staff example before we go on to our next workflow, which is how do you prep for dinners? Tell me I just this little tab is calling my name. I must know. >> All right, so I'm going to a dinner tonight. Um it is called the CXO Collective. And what I did was I took a screenshot of this guest list. And so, you know, I'll show you. Uh, it's, you know, I basically literally just took a screenshot of this guest list and then I dropped it in here. So, you [snorts] can see the image that I dropped in here. And then it it read each of them. And it I haven't looked at this yet, so I can't tell you if this is good or not. Um, buyer beware. Uh, it's free. So, um, and then it went and did search on every single person on that list. And then I have an agent that is basically kind of like going and like doing more analysis on like this happens to be one of my colleagues who's going to the dinner guy leaf and so you know like he was acquired. So it looks like they're like actually identifying the right person. So it what it does is it goes and it does a search on the web then it does a search in LinkedIn then it goes and tries to do like more web search and you know it's like hey this is your colleague that pretty good and it it also has like the the other thing that I would say that I have given this is a lot of context about me. So let me see if I can just show you a couple of examples. Yeah. So I have like some general about me documents like this is from like some communication workshops that I went to where this is like kind of how I want to communicate. This is like personal resources about me and they're all I try to do everything in markdown just so it's easier for the models to understand it. And then this I actually generated like a I try to generate this maybe once a month of like what are the new Web Flow products um off of our release notes so that it kind of like knows everything that we've released in the last couple of years. Um, and so then it kind of knows a lot about me and then it's telling me about the venue. Uh, and then it's like what are hot discussion topics. Um, and you know I'm going to like an AI marketer kind of AEO answer engine optimization uh, dinner and you know then it's like created this full prep doc. So I'm like okay that's great. And then what you can see is I'm like can you add it to my dinner research tab? So the everything that's in dinner research is actually a markdown file. So that's the other way that this has like worked really well. Um I could go and open this up in cursor if I could find that file and then but really I just find it easier for something like this to go into my chief of staff and then let's see pretty oh it's going to be a nice dinner and you know it's like these are my priority connections like conversation starters. Um, you know, I'm like this is like kind of the introvert in me or maybe the ambivert trying to like uh be prepped. Um, just I love this because I am an introvert. I get invited to these dinners all the time. Um, and this is this is really great. One of the things I want to call out for how I AI um watchers and listeners is I recently did a mini episode on how to generate a markdown powered personal app. And so, you know, instead of having to toss these files into a database or into a file store, you can just store them as markdown files inside your repo and then display them on the front end using a markdown renderer and then it looks really nice. So I think again when you're building sort of a personal um app for you know your own research or context just use markdown files as a source of truthful content and display those markdown files in a nice way on the front end. Simplifies things. You don't have to think about a database. And the benefit is then any of those markdown files can be referenced by any of the agents that you use for other things. So, you could go to Cloud Code and say something like, \"Hey, um, grab the dinner prep from that steakhouse dinner I went to last month and remind me of who that person was at Twitter that I was supposed to talk to. I never got to talk to her and I want to send her an email.\" Like, that kind of stuff can really help just make not only the the software, the personal software better, but also just your use of overall um, Aentic tools a lot better. Yeah, I I feel like it's been a game changer to start using markdown files. Um, and then also start using markdown for even like PRDs. So, a lot of times I'm like updating this app and I have like kind of an ongoing PRD that's like self-documenting this app. >> I love it. And so, what do you think the result of you building this chief of staff has been? Um, how has it helped you? Are you saving time? Do you feel like your life is a little bit better? Obviously, you've learned more about AI. kind of what is the outcome you've gotten here? Yeah, I think that the biggest outcome for me has number one been really being like close to the metal in terms of like building out AI products and I am the one that is like you know able to have very very detailed conversations like for example I didn't get a chance to this morning but I'm going to go and start using Gemini 3 um as part of this app and there's certain types of um it's gotten me very close to our code base as Well, um, so for example, I, you know, I have like I I use codeex a lot. Right now I'm only using it on this particular app, but I could like go and be like, tell me about uh this app. How is it built? And I think that that's really important to be able. So I also obviously have access to our rep our monor repo. And so a lot of times like this happens to be for telling me about this repository, right? But this is like a really good starting point um for anybody who's going to go build something because then you can start to understand well how is this app that we build actually built and I think that that it was almost something that was inaccessible unless you were sitting there and like reading code which you know sometimes I do but I I think that this is like very accessible to anybody. >> This is awesome. And again, you can just add modules, you can spin up new quad code interfaces, and then you can design whatever you want on the front end. It can look however >> exactly >> however you want, which I love. Well, I want to flip this to another use case in the second half of our episode, which is a little bit less about how you personally use AI, even though we've we've shown that a little bit. I do want to talk about how you get AI into your team. And so I want to talk about your builder days because I think you know what you're setting a really great example of is I'm a CPO. You say you think of yourself as an IC CPO. I I do as well which is like we're going to do the work. We're going to get into it. Part of it is setting an example of how the work gets done. And then part of it is you have no credibility if you don't actually know what you're talking about to convince other people to do something in their job. And so this is a little bit of a different how I AI which is how I AI into an organization and you've done these builder days. So tell us a little bit more about this. >> Yeah, so we did a builder day last Wednesday. Um so this is pretty fresh and that's the second builder day that we did in this particular way. So maybe first I'll talk about the results because I think that it's actually helpful to see that. So this is a screenshot from Hex that was a dashboard um that shows all of the roles under my team and then after builder day one which was just design we had maybe half the team using cursor and you what what I think is really cool is like very few people were using it before that and then it became this like kind of sustained use because we helped people get over that hump and you know not everybody and then we just did a builder day part two And I'll talk about a little bit about how we actually ran that builder day, but we had design product uh data science, user research, analytics, engineering, you know, lots of different functions um build for builder day. And what we realized in order to get more people over that hump, and by the way, I don't think this is everyone. I think we actually had something like 80 plus prototypes that were actually built that day. Not all in cursor. Um but you know, this is like I'm excited to see like does this continue to be sustained? um is this something that people start to use as part of their day-to-day? And you know, I I really think about um an organization kind of similar to any normal distribution curve um where you're going to have, you know, it's the innovator's dilemma where you have like the early adopters, right? And you know, we've we identified a lot of these early adopters here back in like March, let's say. And then those people actually built out the scaffolding for May for our first builder day. And then as we had more and more people working, we actually had like a bigger user group um that was inside our organization that were maybe the early majority. And now we're starting to, you know, build into the kind of like middle part of that distribution or even maybe some of the lagards um that are by just trying to reduce the friction and then trying to lean into the people who are really embracing that technology. Um, and and I think it needs to be both, you know, a top- down mandate. Like I tell my team, hey, you can't get into a meeting with me without a prototype. So there's a mandate, but then it's also a bottoms up. So I think it kind of has to go both directions. >> So this is the outcome you're trying to drive, which is like we want to use these tools. We want to feel like not just during this spike, but overall in our day-to-day, those tools are useful to my team. And so explain to us what a builder day is and how it drives you towards that outcome. >> Yeah, so we're builder day is when our entire organization stopped doing what they're doing and they built a prototype for whatever they wanted it to be. Um, and the goal was really to boost confidence, um, spark adoption. And so we had a couple of different types of tools. Um, we lit up cursor, figma make, and web flow. Um, and I'll talk about how we actually enabled the organization around that. And then we actually had like different tracks for different types of teams. So we had different assignments for product. We had, you know, you can explore a new product idea. um you can validate user interactions, you can test product concepts, you can build a full-end workflow, you know, we so we we also had them do like a a warm-up assignment and then we basically had like support channels. So we had a couple of engineers that were on call for this. We ran like a judging panel. So like me and the CEO and a couple of other crossunctional leaders were the actual judging panel. We had prizes, recognition, different categories. Um and then we we you know really focus on like how do we measure success and do this again and so you know this is something that is like evolving for us. This isn't we we we definitely aren't like we've we've nailed every single part of this but I was really encouraged to see so many people actually like taking one step outside of their comfort zone. >> Amazing. And so this is something that for the leaders out there that are just looking to like how can I accelerate adoption? how can I up, you know, upgrade our learning and development in the org, not in this ad hoc way. This is 100% the advice I give them. Um, a builder day, a hackathon, and it has to be a combination of tools, access, education, real prototypes, and prizes. People love the prizes. And so if you can make this something really fun, I think it's a super effective way to engage the whole organization and just becoming more AI AI native. And I would I would just ask you, you know, what's the feedback from the team? What's the kind of before and after you're seeing from the team before and after these builder days? >> Yeah, I mean, so I actually like copy and pasted literally the feedback that we got from our survey, so you can go and see it. Um, most people were not frustrated, which made me really happy, which meant that we had like gotten around of the a lot of the technical issues. I think people found it fun, empowering, motivating, and eye-opening. I don't think people understood what was possible. >> Yeah. >> And that to me was like the most heartwarming thing I could possibly imagine. Um, is all these people I I call it getting bluepilled, right? like all these people all of a sudden like stepped into a a new part of their professional journey and that that just made me really happy. >> So to recap this for any of the CPOS or executives or aspiring CPOS or executives out there, you know, a couple takeaways from this episode is one, there is just no substitute for getting your hands on to these tools, especially coding things. I think is very important in almost any role. I've been saying over and over and over again, this is the era of the hard skill. And one of the hard skills I just think is going to become more table stakes is at least being able to use code to get things done. Even if you can't be an exceptional software engineer, that you can build yourself custom software, especially markdown based um that has both sort of agentic access properties where cloud code could use it and web UI. You could run it locally if you don't want to deploy anything. it's not a big deal and it also helps you kind of bypass some of the um security concerns around using thirdparty tools because you're running things locally, you're using, you know, internally approved API keys. All those sorts of things kind of help you um stay sandboxed in your environment. And then organizationally and culturally, these builder days can have a very repeatable structure. And so if people want this, I think you're going to share this repo and this resource with us so you can look at it. there's a repeatable process for onboarding, educating, engaging, and driving sustained adoption of AI in your org through um these sort of spikes in builder days. And then you're just having fun. Are you having fun? Because I am having so much fun right now. And that's one of one of the reasons why I'm spending so much time on AI is it's just it's it's better than it used to be for my job. I think it's the most amazing time to ever be doing this job in the entire time that I've been doing it. Um, it's it's a hard job. I think it's just building products is hard, but it's never been more fun and the possibilities have never been, you know, quite so unlimited. >> I completely agree. Okay, let's do some lightning round questions and then let's get you back to >> um I just have to call it out. Your two cursor windows down at [laughter] the bottom, one of us, as we say. Okay, so first lightning round question. This is hyper hyper hyper personalized software. Is this a product or do you think that just every CPO needs to go out there and build their you know as I say artisal farmtotable chief of staff for your app? You know where where do you fall on this like personal software versus small market SAS for for something like this? I think that parts of this are probably a product. Like I'd imagine that, you know, maybe Anthropic tries to build this themselves, right? Where it's like everybody's chief of staff, not just for a product leader. Um, that may not kind of get it everything that people want. And so you may end up having kind of extensions off of that or right but I think there's going to be a whole ecosystem around how to actually like kind of get work done and what people are doing with MCPS is just the beginning. It's still like let me tell you like the very early days of being able to access company data. Um but I do think that this is an app. I just don't know if it's going to be exactly this form factor. >> Yeah. And then my second question for you, which is a little bit more on the people side, which is you clearly care about AI fluency, how are you hiring for that? How is your team reacting to it? How are you evaluating and promoting kind of what's your framework for talent around this? >> Yeah, I I actually tried to share a little bit of that in this um in this app so that you can kind of see that. But I think that AI is almost like you have to look at each of the different dimensions of your team. Whether it's data and insights, whether it's tool fluency, you know, like builder culture, career ladder, interviewing, like you have to look at every single aspect of how you, you know, your operating system for your team and kind of like grade yourself and be like, how far have we moved um down this spectrum? And you know, in our case, like we're in the middle of redoing our career ladder. Um, because I wanted it to be really clear to people that it's not just fluency, it's like I expect people to like lead and own and understand what is possible and push the limits of our product. Um, and you know, it's not just for themselves, it's for our customers. Um, and then I think you have to kind of like reinvent so many different parts of your your practice as a leader. Um, and so that's that's the skill that you kind of need to lead into as a leader is just like reinvention at all times. >> Okay. And then my final question for you, I ask everybody. You have dueling claws open too. So this is an interesting question, but when you are prompting and he's just not listening, he's just not giving you what you want or your chief of staff is too mean. This is really funny because usually I see so many AI agents be too nice, but yours is actually really mean. [gasps] What is your prompting technique? Are you an all cap? Your your AI is an all caps AI. So I'm curious if you go you hit hard right back at it. What's your prompting technique? >> My prompting technique is first when I don't like what it's giving me, I will clear cloud code. So, a lot of times I'll like clear it and then I'll try again and if I'm still not getting what I want, I'll be like be a 100x more this thing that I want or, you know, be 10x. And so, it's like I almost use like 10x as like a little bit more and 100x as like go and just like rip it apart and do something else. So, this is a repeated tip. We heard this from Hillary at Whoop in one of our early Howi AI episodes, which is these models like numbers. So say be like 20%, you know, nicer or be 100x more harsh or make this three times as purple. Whatever it is, you can quantify it. It can calibrate um how it's working for you. So great, great tip. Well, Rachel, thank you for joining us on how aai. How can we find you and how can we be helpful to you? >> Yeah. Uh thanks again, Claire. This is amazing.

    "transcript": "I had tried cursive for the first time and what I was able to create just blew me away. I sent a message to my manager, my manager's manager, the CPO and then a few other folks that I knew were really interested in AI and I was like, \"Listen, I had this really profound experience and I think we really need to uplevel the skill of our entire product organization, not just designers, but also PMs. We need to become more familiar with this technology. We need to understand how we can use it.\" This is actually the message that I sent while I was on paternity leave that definitely got my leaders really fired up. I didn't know exactly how this was going to go. All I knew was that I needed to get more folks paying attention to this AI stuff. >> If you were the first to raise your hand that says, you know what, I want to figure out how our team can use AI. I'm going to lead this organization. It's such a unique leadership opportunity to show crossf functional broad impact on teams. [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claravo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have Brian Greenbomb at Pendo and he's going to show us not only how he uses AI in his own product work, but his step-by-step plan for getting your product and design teams adopting AI as well. Let's get to it. [music] This podcast is supported by Google. Hey everyone, Shishta here from Google DeepMind. The Gemini 2.5 family of models is now generally available. 2.5 Pro, our most advanced model, is great for reasoning over complex tasks. [music] 2.5 Flash finds the sweet spot between performance and price. [music] And 2.5 Flash Light is ideal for low latency, high volume tasks. Start building in Google AI Studio at a.dev. >> Ryan, thanks for joining us on how I AI. Happy to have you. >> Yeah, so excited to be here. Well, what I am excited about in our conversation is in a lot of our How I AI episodes, we've shown specific ways that you can use specific tools to build or do things with AI. And you're going to help us take a step back and say, you know, let's say you have all these tools and you want to start using them. How do you get a full team or a full organization, a full company actually adopting AI? And so this is a how I get everybody else to use AI episode. So I would love to start with what I call the inception phase which we all have gone through or are all in the process of trying to get our team to go through which is when you get people excited and sort of jumpstart the energy around AI and I think you approach this in a really interesting way. So I'd love you to walk us through what you did at Pendo. >> Yeah, absolutely. So to take you back, um it's the end of last year. So last July, I had uh my daughter Meer, my daughter Maya was born. Um you can kind of see the nursery in my background with this is sort of shared office uh nursery. Um and I was on paternity leave at the end of last year and I'm um sort of like a tech geek. I've been following AI for a while. Like my day job is a designer at Pendo, but you know, I've always sort of been into tech and so been following AI very closely. Um, I've also had some experience like building side projects and things like that. And I think it was back in November, cursor came out or maybe it was a little bit earlier than that, but cursor I had tried cursor for the same for the first time. And what I was able to create just blew me away. So I had like a side project idea, this hobby app in my in my mind about a music player where I can um play albums by scanning a QR code on on sort of like a a piece of paper. I was very jealous of people who had record players. don't have space for a record player in New York and they get to choose music by sort of flipping through through albums and uh I like having you know unlimited access to to music via Spotify but I sort of miss that sort of like tactile um experience. So I was like what if I create these sort of like laminated cards and I have this way of just being able to play the albums that are on that. Um so I had this idea of like what if I can create sort of a mobile app where I can scan like a QR code or I could recognize the album cover and I can print these album covers out and just be limited in in that way. And uh I I had no idea how to do that like on my own. Like I'm not an active developer. I can't sit down and write that application. And I pulled up cursor and like within a couple hours I had a working prototype. And like that just blew me away. I was creating QR codes. I was >> [laughter] >> uh creating PDFs. I was like doing all this like really really really cool stuff. And um you know like I said my my day job is is a product designer. And I immediately understood that like, okay, this is really cool as a sort of side project. That's really fun, but I could use this to build interactive prototypes. Um, I'm I'm I consider myself pretty proficient with Figma, especially when it comes to prototyping, but I understand the limitations of using Figma for prototyping. Um, a lot of what I do at Pendo is sort of working on features that are analytics based. And so, when you're creating mock-ups and prototypes that are data driven, it's really hard to communicate what the, you know, how these things are actually going to work with real data. So having a prototype that is codebased that is working with even just fake data and interacting sort of in a more dynamic way is really useful. So I was like wow I we could really use this appendo. Um so I had the you know even though I am on paternity leave you know I had this idea and I was like I couldn't contain myself you know I had I wasn't going to come back to work until the beginning of January. So in December um I wrote a whole bunch of folks at Pendo. still had access to my Slack. And so I wrote, you know, uh I sent a message to my manager, my manager's manager, the CPO, um and then a few other folks that I knew were really, really interested in AI. And I was like, listen, I had this like really profound experience. And I think, you know, uh we really need to uplevel the skill of our entire product organization, not just designers, but also PMs. We need to become more familiar with this technology. We need need to understand how we can use it. I had already understood that like there's no playbook for how to learn this stuff. There's no class you can take. Um there's no book you can read. And the technology is evolving so fast that the only way to really know how to apply it is to become very familiar with how it works to kind of stay current with all the latest technologies and the tools and just sort of like see a bunch of examples and like selfishly like I wanted to spend more of my time at work doing these things, but I also wanted to um help my my colleagues and my company just be more successful because I I saw a clear path to that and just getting more pe more my peers, more of my colleagues like doing the same thing and sharing their experiences. is uh I know would help me learn and I think it would just sort of like you know uh rise all the boats and so this is sort of an example here not example this is actually the message I pulled it up uh that I sent while I was on paternity leave just to kind of give you an example um of what something like this looks like um and I wrote this like pretty long message I mean for folks that are um not watching this you know I just kind of said TLDDR in a similar fashion to uh you know there's an and there's an engineering focused uh sort of group uh that had that had been around for at least a here but nothing really focused on PMs and designers. I was like I'd like to lead um a group like that uh before a cross functional cross functional product team with design designers PMs and etc with two goals. Um Pendo's product team can leverage the cutting edge of AI tools to get more done in fewer hours and less resources improve decision-m and communicate and validate ideas more effectively. And then two, because Pendo is also sort of servicing a lot of product organizations that are going through similar transformation um to help position Pendo as a thought leader in the space because I knew it was going to be really important. And then I went through like a longer version of sort of like my my experience of like building this app and um and why I thought it was important. And um you know I'm really fortunate to be part of an organization that uh supports sort of initiatives like this. And so I, you know, that that definitely got uh my my leaders like really fired up. In fact, the CPO was like, \"Hey, can you come to like all hands next Monday and talk about this this concept?\" And I was like, \"I'm on paternity leave. I can't do it yet.\" Um uh but I will start as soon as I come back. And so that that's sort of that's sort of what happened. So that was a catalyst for uh this idea. And I gotta say like I'm I'm the kind of person that uh you know sometimes I can be like type A and like really like think things through, but I also know that sort of committing to something or just like forcing myself to like throw myself into a situation um without knowing like how it's going to work out uh can also result in something really interesting. Um so I didn't know exactly how this was going to go. All I knew was that I needed to get more folks paying attention to this AI stuff, and I also needed to create time in people's calendar where everyone could just like focus on it and play or maybe um uh like uh hear a presentation on on something new. >> So, I have to call out a couple things here that I think are really important. one for anybody trying to, you know, give a a a justification if you if you need it for investing extra time, resources, and energy into this AI transformation in your organization. I love that you call out actually the two things that really matter. They're very similar things to um how I called out the value of AI transformation at Launch Darkly, which was one, our team's got to know how to use this stuff. like we've just got to know how to use these tools, get more done, be more efficient, just use the best of the best. The second one though I think is really interesting and there's still a lot of opportunity here. You know, you're on this podcast which is there's this opportunity for leading organizations to position themselves as thought leaders in how you get stuff done with AI in your vertical. And so for us it was like we have to be great AI engineers because we need to you know be great engineers generally. This is the next phase of how software engineering is going to get done. We need to be thought leaders in the space. And very similarly for you on the product side. I think it's just really important that you can create platforms for your company to be experts in the space if you lean in early into these technologies. You know, the other thing I want to call out is, you know, I try to tell people about this all the time. This is like promo making work. [clears throat] And what I mean is like this is the kind of initiative that doesn't come around that often as an opportunity. And if you are the first to raise your hand, like if you are the first designer that says, you know what, I want to figure out how our team can use AI. I'm going to lead this organization. It's such a unique leadership opportunity to show crossf functional broad impact on teams and like there's only gonna be one or two of you that get to be the leader of it. So I'm like really encouraging people to be like you raise your hand early to take on the initiative for the organization. One because I think it's the right thing to do for the team, but two, it's really great from a personal career perspective. >> Absolutely. And like you know I wasn't I wasn't going to focus on that. Um but I will but like what you're saying is absolutely 100% true. So um like this this sort of uh initiative has opened so many doors. We'll get into it in a moment but it's opened so many doors internally within the organization. Like I'm speaking with you. There's no way I think I would be speaking on such a high-profile podcast if I didn't start working on this and sort of build up a sort of the the body of work that I have over the last nine months. Um I get to work on some really cool AI projects. Um, I have folks throughout the organization that are not even in product and and and and design, folks I didn't even know reaching out to me and sort of like looking to me as a thought leader. And that wasn't my intent, but it's absolutely true. It's like there there are opportunities across um all organizations right now regardless of your level. I mean, I'm a senior staff um but I'm an IC. I'm I'm just a product designer like but I'm having an influence way beyond my my scope. And I think uh regardless of where you are like if you have the initiative and the energy and it does take a little bit of time like there is some nights and weekends that like I kind of put into it but I also love this stuff like I was kind of doing it anyway and so absolutely it is it is a career builder builder. >> Yeah. And then you know maybe my last reflection is do you know how many people I know that have gone on parental leave and in between rocking their newborn have been shipping stuff with like like cursor like every single parent I know. This just might be my my peer cohort. Everyone I know has been texting me from parental leave being like, \"Claire, I've been vibe coding with my baby and I am so into it.\" So, if you have uh if you have somebody on parental leave right now, it's very likely they're going to come back um AI pilled for sure because that is what I have seen consistently with with some of my friends. Okay. So, let's actually get into this message, kick things off, but then you actually have to functionally make this happen. and you sort of had like a two-pronged approach to two things that were really effective in getting this going in your organization. So what were those two things? >> Yep. Yeah. Um so the two things um so I'm just kind of bringing up here um in case it's helpful. So this was sort of the first announcement I made within the organization had come back in January. Um we this is sort of like our private channel of the entire product organization. So within Pendo product the product team are PMs, designers, writers um and a few other folks. And so I was like, hey, I'm starting this initiative. And um in my mind, I I I was thinking that there's sort of a two-prong approach. There's an asynchronous and a synchronous. One thing that I um uh was very familiar with, like just in my own life, but also talking to other people, is that you'll typically hear something like, \"Yeah, that AI stuff like I know it's important, but I just don't have the time.\" Like I don't have the time to like watch all the videos and you know, vibe code and lovable or whatever it is, right? And the crazy thing is like if you don't make the time for it, you're never going to learn it and at some point you're going to get behind, right? And so it was really important for not just there to be a place within Slack and encourage people to share on Slack asynchronously to do it at their own pace, but also to create time in people's calendars so that they can come um and focus on like whatever the topic is. And also within that session, it's not just about a presentation. It's also like it's really important for that presentation or that session to be interactive. So let me give you an example of that. So this was this was a this was a kickoff as well as an exercise about building apps. Um just to sort of give you a insight into how I start started this off. I was like hey AI is getting better. It's getting faster and it's evolving how software is planned, designed and built. And this was really meant to speak to not just us as builders but also sort of the the product that Pendo was building. And uh right around that time, Andrew Ing had a a really I thought thoughtful blog post about how he was thinking about how uh PMs need to position themselves sort of in the AI in in this AI future. And then AI is typically sort of in the space of sort of engineering and technical stuff and you know he was positioning AI as perhaps being uh or at least engineers being better positioned to sort of like take advantage of all this stuff because they are technical. Um but he's saying it was really important for PMs and I would also put designers in that camp as well uh to become proficient. And so these were the sort of five things that he was he really wanted to focus on technical proficiency um just iterating on the development like using AI in a sort of iterative capacity uh being very proficient with data skill and managing ambiguity and then ongoing learning. So like that was really sort of the emphasis I wanted to drive. Um and so again the structure of sort of like or at least the goal sorry the goals of the the product AI was around to uh uplevel and modernize the skill set of our of our product people to improve our comprehension and literacy and then because our customers are also builders to empathize and assist with them as well. And I wasn't sure if this technique again was going to work but this was how I was thinking about approaching it. just being more hands-on, getting our hands dirty, radical many to many sharing, being intentional, creating the space, and then identifying the patterns that worked, um, and then sort of turn those into reusable patterns. So, in this opening session, like I was saying, like it's really important to have an interactive session. And I'm not going to go through the slides of like how I talked about code building tools and the different, you know, the various types and some things that I had built. Um, but there was a section that was at least I think 10 15 minutes where I was like, \"All right, everyone, you know, go to bolt.new.\" That was the app that we chose to use at the time and create an account if you haven't created an account. And then everyone go to Bolt and copy and paste this. So, this was just a prompt that I had created. Uh, it wasn't hyper optimized. It was about creating a to-do list, the most basic like little mini SAS app that you could possibly build. And I had everyone type this in. And then there was like a little enhanced prompt thing that I wanted everyone to use just to sort of see how like uh this this app could sort of take a very basic thing and and turn it into a more sophisticated thing and then let it rip and hit go. And I would say I wasn't expecting this when I did this the first time, but the thing that really stood out because it was sort of like obvious to me that this is this is what would happen. But the some of the feedback I got was like wow like we all typed in the same thing. We all clicked on the enhance prompt button and we all got different results. So like this was just sort of an example of like these were all the to-do list applications that the app created after running that that query and I think in in a third of the cases like bolt just came back and said nope like like like error whatever and then like so we immediately got into sort of the whole oh okay don't worry like if you get an error just to fix it blah blah blah and everyone sort of like got through it after two or three rounds. So that is like it was great to experience that as a team and not only just to like do it and see how it worked but also to see the diversity of like how like these applications um are built and how Genai is being used and then the other thing I had people do in the last like 105 minutes is experiment on their own and I told people just to do crazy stuff like we're not doing this for any like we're not really building a to-do list and the AI will do its best to um do as you say so you can give it like the most wacky you know instructions right like, you know, make it, you know, add a retro 8bit pixel art theme, you know, introduce a dark mode title, make it look like MySpace from 2007. And so that was sort of like an interesting thing, too. So, like people sort of like went nuts. They shared some things like I think there's a few examples here of like people saying, \"Oh, you know, I tried. Yeah, here here this is what UI will look like in 20 uh 200. Here's my Tumblr style, you know, to-do list.\" Um, and like this was intentional to sort of like make it fun. These are designers, but there's also PMs and like we all know sort of like the there's a line between sort of like professional stuff and personal stuff. Um, but like what I really wanted people to experience is that uh this can be fun and just like to broaden their minds about how they can apply this technology. One thing I want to call out as a meta benefit to this slide that you showed and maybe we could go back to it of like now go wild or or optimize it is I think as designers and product managers in companies and you can tell me if you have a different experience but we have just gotten beaten by the scope creep stick so frequently that we have actually lost our muscle for like asking for the magic thing. We always start with the MVP. We always start with like what is the bare minimum thing I can ship to meet the user requirements that I know engineering can do and like we've lost this ability to imagine like what if it did this and what if it did that and it could be interactive or there could be voice and what I like about AI is one it makes those magic things a lot easier to build you know more efficient to build but two like it's going to let designers ers and product managers return to the craft of building the awesome product as opposed to like the viable product which is so like if you reflect on it it's so sad that we have put on a pedestal like minimum viability as just like such a low bar and now our bar can just be so much higher for what we build but you have to like reignite this muscle of like how to even think about what those things could be. So, I love the idea that you, you know, put these uh these iterations in categories like visual iterations, interactive iterations, entertaining or gamification iterations, and then like media again is something that's really interesting that you can do with AI. I know as a designer like how many times have you been like, \"Oh, an illustration would be amazing here, but no one wants to spend the time to like draw a custom icon or a photo would be here, but like we don't have any stock photo budget for this project, so I'm just going to like erase that and put whites space.\" And so I just think like that piece is so underrated for AI is like getting out of getting us out of MVP mode. >> Yeah. And I got actually a really cool example of that as well. So like, you know, that was the sessions, right? But then there's also the channel and so um you know there people are constantly sharing things links to articles experiments that they've tried. I mean that was the whole intent of it right is just to sort of have a space where people can share things and I think there's an example in here where ah yes here it So Mark, you a he's a a product designer and I think this was right around the time that Midjourney um launched the ability to do animations or video and he was like, \"Wouldn't it be cool to have, you know, sort of in this intro screen these little animated characters that sit there and just like wave at you, right?\" >> And it's so cute. >> Exactly. Right. [laughter] >> And that it wasn't that hard. I mean, like I think he, you know, he iterated on a couple of problems like this, this is not in the product. It's not in the product yet, but I mean, he was able to create an asset that not that hard to drop in if you have the right spot for it. Um, and like like you said before, it was, oh man, like really cool to have like an illustration or an animation, but I got to go talk to a professional or I got to go spend like nights and weekends working on it. It's like not worth the effort. And now we can bring a little more life into our applications. >> And that life of course turns into like what I just did, which is like, oh my god, I love it. Which is just like customer connection to your brand, to your product. um a little bit of sense of like this team actually really cares about the craft and is going to continue to invest in this product experience all that all the great stuff and then I I just want to call out for folks that maybe missed this in part of the transition. So the two kind of major pieces you put in were these sessions, these product and AI sessions, and you showed us the kickoff deck of what that looked like, both the why and then like let's actually get into it. Let's do it together. And then the second piece, that's the sync piece. Um, and you do those weekly, right? Or just >> we do them bi-weekly. I mean, we could probably do them weekly, but we've we've done them bi-weekly. >> Yeah. I um I I I put in a we put in a similar thing. um we called them like AI power hours on Friday and it was like every week we we would do that. And then the second thing is the async channel which like if you do not have it you should definitely have it where folks are just sharing and I like this bullet point that you had in your slide that was like radical peer-to-peer share. I forget what it said but it was such a good phrase. Yeah. Radical many to many sharing. And so one of the things that I think organizations often suffer from during this AI transformation is information hoarding and like secret AI. And I think it happens for two reasons. Secret AI can happen because people aren't sure what they can use and we're going to talk about that in a minute. And so they like kind of pretend they're not using AI or they use their like Gmail account, Gmail chat GBT account because they don't want to get in trouble but they're going to use it anyway. And so there's like secrecy because people don't know the golden path of using AI. And then there's like information and skills hoarding right now, which is like the dark side of being an AI agent or an AI change agent, which is people are like, well, I'm the only one that knows how to do this. So I'm going to stand out if I'm like extra good uh on these things or just get my work done faster or whatever. And so this like build in public many to many sharing is so important for a healthy culture around AI transformation. I cannot emphasize this this one enough. >> Absolutely. >> This episode is brought to you by Lovable. If you've ever had an idea for an [music] app but didn't know where to start, Lovable is for you. Lovable lets you build working apps and websites by simply chatting with AI. [music] Then you can customize it, add automations, and deploy it to a live domain. It's perfect for marketers spinning up tools, product managers prototyping new ideas, or founders [music] launching their next business. Unlike no code tools, Lovable isn't about static pages. It [music] builds full apps with real functionality. And it's fast. What used to take weeks, months, or even years, you can now do over the weekend. So, if you've been sitting on an idea, now's the time to bring it to life. [music] Get started for free at lovable.dev. That's lovable.dev. You implemented this back in January, back from from uh leave. We're can you believe it? The year is like almost over. We're like we're like there. It's unbelievable. >> I know. >> Um and and you know, how did you actually measure? Did any of this matter, right? Like did we do this and was it fun and or did people actually adopt this and how did you how did you get there? >> Yeah. Yeah. So, um I think there's like there's several ways I can answer that question. The first is like, you know, I >> I didn't intend to have to implement a companywide transformation, right? Like I I needed to start uh somewhere or at least I wanted to really focus on my craft and the people that are around me. So that was product design, a little bit of engineering, right? And so product AI is intentionally focused on the area around creating products um using AI to um do design, product management, engineering, that sort of thing. It wasn't intended to sort of like branch out to you know how does revenue sell better or how does finance do whatever finance does better right? Um the channel so like it really it was really important for the channel to be public. We have like 200 plus people on the channel now. That is way more than the product organization. So the thing is like even if you're sort of focusing on a functional area um there's aspects of that functional area that bleeds outside of the organization. Um so just to kind of give you a perspective on like the sessions that we ran right so we started back in January we were doing it every two weeks and you can kind of see sort of like some of the the different topics. It wasn't just all about vibe coding. It's about prompting. It's about you know how do you take customer feedback and sort of make sense of it. Um there's sessions here on just like diving into just Gemini. I mean like we have access to all a whole bunch of Google features from Google that are AI related and they're spread out throughout their entire ecosystem. So it's like hey what's what are all the things that we can do to sort of take advantage of that and that was one where I intentionally made it not just about product and design because like you know the the finance people and the revenue people could definitely take advantage of things like deep research within Gemini or the AI function within within uh sheets. So sometimes like it makes sense to sort of like really promote these things outside but again it was like you know you kind of want to make sure that you stay within your group. And then separately there was an initiative uh an OKR in the first quarter of of this year. Our quarters begin in February. So I had started this. Yeah. What's it's so weird enterprise enterprise sales uh fiscal year right there. [laughter] >> Yeah. It it it really confuses me because like we're in fiscal year 2026. Like I thought still >> 2022 and it's October. What's happening? >> Yeah, totally. Um so yeah, we're like a little like one month off. So our quarters begin in in uh in February. So I had started this and I think because you know to your to your point earlier about like how this this uh is also a good career move. It adds a lot of visibility I think to you if you sort of take the initiative. Like I had just started this a couple weeks earlier, but I was invited to be part of a crossf functional group that was responsible for a companywide OKR to improve um um AI AI leverage within the organization. And so um I can show you some of the things that we did but like I think the most important thing uh that we did was just measuring right just measuring sort of like what is the and we called it a sentiment survey because like we didn't really know what people's or like my colleagues uh feelings were about AI right like because you know you might feel like AI is taking your job or AI is creating slob or you might feel that like AI is such like a cool fun like incredibly transformational technology that you know is gonna solve cancer, right? Like I don't know what the the sentiment is. We weren't really, you know, you're not h you were never really hiring for the skill or this attitude, right? And so you have a group of folks and you know you're thinking about instituting a transformation on how they work and the technology they use. And so it was really important I think for us to get a temperature read on like how people felt about AI. But we also wanted to know other dimensions as well. Are they aware of the like for instance are they familiar with our usage policy? Right? There's a lot of shadow IT happening just like you said like people are using their Gmail their personal chat GBT accounts to do professional work and they're not sure is like is that cheating? Is that allowed? Um or even like what kind of data am I allowed to put into chat GBT? Can I put like customer transcripts in there? Like I don't I don't know what the answer is. And some people are just doing it because they know it's going to be helpful and some people are not doing it because they're worried that you know that's not that's not cool. Um, and the other thing too is like they don't know what tools are available because yeah, I mean like you have Salesforce, you have Gmail, but you don't like we at the point at that time we didn't have companywide licenses for chat GBT, right? So like no one knows what what is actually available to them. Um, and so what I'm showing here is like the beginning of the quarter. So like the idea was we would do some things within the quarter, but in the beginning of the quarter we take this baseline and we asked these five questions and we also got some uh some qual feedback as well. So it kind of gave us a little um an idea sort of like you know why things were trending in a certain way. Um and then one thing that we we we noticed and you're kind of looking at sort of like the trend of what happened be from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. Uh there was an increase along all of these measurements and the biggest ones were around this uh usage policy and which tools do I have available to me. I think the biggest gap was here because we didn't spend any time with it. So there was a lot of work done in that quarter um just by making people aware of what they can do and how they can request software. So here's a just a screenshot of an internal uh uh confluence document we call the AI knowledge center. And in this document um is all the information that an employee needs to know about which AI tools they have available to them. So, like if you were to scroll down, you'd get this like alphabetized table of all the products that have been approved to be used within our organization for security reasons, um, for for legal reasons. I mean, the the thing is that like AI is a is a vector for doing some really bad stuff. And even though you want to move fast and you want to use all of these really cool tools, you don't want to put your company and your customers data at risk. And so it's really important that you know you work closely with your security, your IT department, your finance department, your legal department. And like again I was very fortunate in to be in an organization where like those folks which sometimes can feel like friction and a barrier like they um I think they recognize that like this was also really important and sort of like prioritized um you know still doing all the the solid work but like adding uh I prioritize sort of like the enabling us to sort of like not just use these tools but experiment with different ones. like I found myself for like a month like every week I was submitting these like zip requests for new software that I wanted to to try out. Um and it would only take maybe like a week for me to sort of get the the okay and you can kind of see like it was really important not just to see which applications I had access to and how how that application could be used but what kind of data can I share within an application as well as if I want to get access to it like what are ways that I can I can get to that. And so when I you know I go back to this slide you know that was that was one of the the the tactical things we're able to get done in a single quarter that really made a huge difference sort of in this um in this metric of awareness about policy and tools. >> I want to just call this out for the leaders on the team that are or the leaders in the audience that are listening. This is the first thing I tell them to do is I say define the golden path to using AI and it takes three pieces. It takes finance and procurement. It takes legal and it takes security. And what I tell them is it's really not going to benefit the acceleration of your team to say we'll go heads down and figure out how you can get chat GBT and cursor and you'll get your three little little tools and we'll let you know what they are. You actually need what you called out which is a very fast path to experimenting with reasonable tools to identify which ones are going to work for your team. And that rapid experimentation is really really important. You can't go do a big like multi-month evaluation of one code editing tool because as you said they're changing so rapidly. And so I love this documented place of like here's the tool, here's the status, here's the data you can put in and the data you can't put in. Here's how you get a license. Here's how you get help. Um is just very very very useful. and and if you can get this done, then it all starts to snowball from there because people have a place and a path to go down. So, I this is probably like not the most exciting screen share we've seen. Like, it's a it's a table and a confluence talk, but like I just want everybody to pause, screenshot this if you do not have this in your org. Like, you need it. Need it today because this is going to be the thing that changes how you work. I love this. >> Yeah, 100%. Um, and like once you kind of get that ball rolling, like you know, there there's a separate channel too, like I think it's called like the AI knowledge center. It's meant to be sort of like the product AI channel but more like broad-based. And every once in a while, someone be like, \"Hey, can I use granola for this?\" And someone outside of it, you know, someone who's just familiar with this with this process would just like, \"Hey, yeah, go check out the thing. You know, yeah, you can use it, but you have to get approval, yada yada yada.\" And so like once you sort of get the ball rolling, you have really good documentation, you just sort of reemphasize this is where you go, this is the process. And on the on the flip side, I mean, I'm not in legal, security, IT, that sort of thing. But like when that those groups um that that group those groups are responsive to an organization that wants to experiment and try this stuff, then that the the flywheel just just keeps going. And um you know like I said in the beginning of the year there was a lot of like confusion about what I can do and whatever and now I wouldn't say it's all gone but like it is nowhere near the top list the top of our list of things that like we are concerned about when it comes to AI transformation. Well, I love this. You know, just to recap, you've shown us how you become a change agent. You know, sort of incept your organization into taking this seriously as an initiative, how you use synchronous meetings and asynchronous Slack channels to drive this as a consistent practice over time. And then you use OKRs to actually measure does any of this matter? And you're showing that like if you put these simple things in place, you can actually inlect those measures which you know just in the looking at the sentiment. Um, I like that last question that you had on the sentiment survey which is like I think this is going to have a positive impact on our employees and that went up and that is a huge win for for a company because a lot of people are feeling fear about their careers, uncertainty, doubt and so the fact that you can show you can do these very simple things and inflect that sentiment very positively in your employee population is also fabulous. So, uh, Brian, this was great. Thank you for showing us again like I could not write a better playbook for getting AI adoption in a team. This is what I've done. I you it works. Let's do this. Let's repeat this and stamp it out in our our own teams. So let's get to some lightning round questions and then we'll get you back to all your fun AI projects. The first question I have is okay. You showed us like you're incepting people and you're you know managing your stakeholders and all that kind of stuff. What is your favorite thing you've built with AI over the last year for for work? I've built a lot of really cool things. Um, the one that I'm most proud of, but it's it's kind of geeky is that I built my own MCP server for Pento. Um, so, uh, back maybe back in the spring whenever when MCP was becoming really hot, uh, folks have been talking about MCP and like how it could be applied to to Pendo. And um what I clearly saw was after using tools like deep research that is essentially like an agent that can you know basically run a bunch of web queries over and over and over again to sort of build up sort of a a research document. I had spent you know I've been in in tech for a while. I I'm a designer now but I've also spent time as a PM and I've done a lot of growth work. And one of the things that is common within growth is you're you're constantly moni monitoring like dashboards of conversion rates and retention and blah blah blah. And every once in a while a number will like dip or will dive, right? And then you're you're off and you're spending like the entire week trying to understand like what is it like? Do we have like an issue? Do we have a bug? Like is there something going on, you know, in one of our regions? uh you know like if you're doing a year-over-year comparison like maybe a holiday fell you know last year and not this year and so like that's why these and usually it's it's like some common sense thing but like if someone above you sort of sees this and they're just like wait a minute like fire drill like we got to go figure it all out and that like just eats up your whole week doing like a lot of like iterative research right looking at the data from different angles and I'm like this could be like like a deep research like query but having access to like our data right um or usage data could be uh like a killer and like NCP is a technology that can leverage that if I can give the AI tools to run these queries and then like use its intelligence to like look at the data and be like oh what about looking at it by region let's look at it a year let's look at it blah blah blah um and so that was sort of like the idea that I had of connecting like okay how this is how MCP could be useful um for our customers right because we also we're a product analytics um provider and so I had this conversation with my colleague colleagues and they're just like I don't know if you know because we have like a a bespoke quering language. It's not SQL, so it it takes, you know, the AI doesn't know how to write those queries, but I I thought I had a way of doing it that that could sort of overcome that. And so over a couple of nights, um I basically just leveraged the MCP documentation giving it to cursor. I have no idea how my I built an MTP server. I have no idea actually how it works, but I understand like right. It's like a lot of >> I'm laughing. I'm laughing. Everybody close your ears. I legitimately approached MCP servers as true sorcery sorcery before I built one. I was so I don't there's there's some branding issue that that the MCP platform and framework has because it seems like sorcery. So I was with you until I actually built one and like you know wrote the code and then I was like oh okay I get it a little bit. There's a lot of elements that make it like really hard to gra like model context protocol. Like what the hell do those words mean? Yeah. >> Like it doesn't actually speak. >> Even the naming it's just okay. So MC framework uh caretakers you might as well call it magic context protocol for for all we know. >> Yeah. Yeah. What one of my most uh popular sessions like so you know it's not just me doing the sessions during product day. other people will do them, but like one of my most popular one one was called WTF is MCP and I just spent like a whole hour telling people what MCP was and afterwards they're like, \"Oh, I get it now. It's kind of like web search but like more tools.\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" But anyway, [laughter] >> so I I I built this thing and like I have like so you know my wife also so works in technology but she's in marketing and I'm sitting like next to her and you know how it is like you have a baby and like you know your your nights are a little bit slower and so you have some slack time just kind of like hang out and she's watching TV and I'm sitting there on the laptop like working on this MCT server and I got it to do a thing right I got it to like you know I wrote a query uh a prompt within claude and it talked to my MCP server and it ran a thing and it returned data back and I was just like, \"You have no idea how how credible this is.\" And she's like, \"I don't know what an MCU is.\" Like, \"What is an MCU?\" And I'm like, \"It's not MCU, it's MCP. God damn it.\" Um, so I recorded so I recorded a demo of me using it. And um, this isn't the exact one, but this is something very similar, which was um, I so I have a the my own MCP server that I hooked up and I was I was just using the public APIs, right? So like I have test accounts for Pendo. I didn't have any special access. I don't have a dev platform. I was just able to like do this on top of the APIs. Actually, any customer could do this. Um, and so I had this MTP server that can do things like just grab really basic stuff like how many pages uh which pages are the top pages, how often they accessed, you know, what are things, you know, what what does this this visitor do and that visitor do? Um, so I was like, can you create a beautiful dashboard that shows me which pages, features, and guides were the most used over the last 30 days? And I think the key thing was that I'm combining accessing the data and uh having it create a dashboard. Uh so I won't kind of go through all the things I did made a bunch of tool calls. That's not really important. But the important thing was at the end I had it put the data into this uh artifact. I'm I'm sitting here in clawude and it's not I mean I wouldn't ship this but just visualizing the connection between taking [clears throat] Pendo data which now you know only exists within Pendo or you can also export it and there's other ways of getting access to it but making it accessible on the level where someone could just type in a thing like tell me who what the top pages are and then show me a dashboard really like changed people's minds and with over the next like couple months like I'm now chatting with the CTO. The CTO is creating another versions MCP um and you know he's so he's create like we're we're iterating creating uh starting to like productional productionize um some of these elements. I mean what I've done here like they just they kind of moved on the it wasn't the code that I wrote or vibe coded was not important. What was what was important was like I was able to demonstrate the value of this somewhat you know hard opaque technology um to folks that like didn't maybe didn't see it in the same way and that has now actually that has like significantly impacted our road map. So like we're working on a lot of agents within Pendo um that are leveraging sort of the MCP but you know behind the scenes and um there's other things that we're planning to do with MCP and we might have gotten there anyway. Um but that uh that uh definitely sort of accelerated our timeline for that. Well, congratulations uh for for cracking through that. And I think what you said is exactly right, which is like the code that you wrote is not important. Like people get so wrapped around the axle on the quality of like quote unquote vibecoded stuff. Not the issue. The issue is until you can internally display value, it is really hard to get anything done in a product organization. And sometimes you can internally display value by saying a customer wants this. Like very easy sales comes. I got like a top quarter making deal. Customer wants that. Okay. Like we love it. But something that's a little bit more nebulous, something that has a little bit more of an intangible value. Like I think we could use this new technology or this new framework MCPS to give our customers a better experience of our product. Like it just doesn't click until you can touch it. And so the more you can use these tools to let your peers sort of like touch your ideas, I think the more as you said you can like impact the road map which is what I hear all the time from designers, engineers, product managers like I'm tired of the road map being given to me. How do I like impact it? And this tool these these tools are definitely a way way of doing that. >> Yeah. And I would say one just one tip around this which I think is really important to emphasize is that you know you might sit sort of like you know you might be designer or PM um I think it's really important for everyone to understand how this technology works like I think you got to get a little more technical you got to understand how LLMs are working you have to understand what like what an agent is you don't have to be able to code these things you don't have to be an ML engineer but um if you are a creative person or someone who is sort of in the solution space and uh is trying to think about like what like what are the different ways that I can apply AI to this this problem. You won't arrive at anything really interesting unless you understand the underlying technology. It's like an architect. Like architects, yeah, they they design like pretty buildings, but they also understand how plumbing works and electric and the electronics work, right? Like they're they're not like the electricians and the plumbers, right? But like in order to build a functional building that stands up and and is functional, right? like you got to have power sockets, you got to have room for the pipes, like all that stuff is important. I think the same thing applies to PMs and designers. And I think if you're an engineer, I think it's also useful to understand like the business side, the customer side, the you know, like to really empathize with the the issue, the the problems that your customers have so that it, you know, like what we're all looking for is basically how do you sort of connect the dots between the technologies that we have available to us to solve customer problems. H I couldn't hype you up more because I have been screaming from the rooftops. This is the era of the hard skill. Like you need the hard skills to take advantage of this stuff. I I didn't call it out earlier, but I saw one of your sessions was like intro to HTML and CSS. Like that is actually going to be the unlock for your designers because if you can read CSS, a whole world has opened up to you with these vibe coding tools. And so yes, you need to know how the stuff actually actually works. Okay, so Brian, last question. This has been so great, but got to have your your strategy here. When AI is not listening, when that NCP is not being vibe coded correctly by cursor, what is your go-to tactic? How do you get it unblocked? Do you yell? >> Uh, you know, I I I don't want to say that I don't yell, but I do yell sometimes. >> [laughter] >> The the other thing that I do too, which I think is also really helpful, is I say, \"Okay, you're not you're not quite getting it.\" Like think think about a different way of approaching this, right? Like I I'm trying to nudge it to like it maybe it's sort of like locked into a certain sort of >> uh groove and I'm trying to to make it think a little more broadly. I I don't know if that actually helps, but I've found that like sometimes that's useful. So like >> if I'm not yelling, it's just like, \"Okay, you tried this a million times. Think about five other different ways that you can solve this problem.\" and and and go for it. >> Yeah, I think that's probably more effective than my no that I do when it's not working. Well, Ryan, this has been awesome. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Yeah, so you can find me on on LinkedIn. Um I try to post when I can and um yeah, I mean, if you're if you're a product builder or um you know, you're interested in working for a a company that is sort of embracing AI, you should check out Pendo. >> Awesome.

    "transcript": "I think from EAS I hear like, \"Oh, AI doesn't think the way I do.\" I'm like, \"It can though. It can as long as you can figure out the system behind why you're doing things and be able to articulate that.\" I think this is going to be one of the most practical, time-saving, and stressaving episodes of how I AI we have ever had. This agent does everything you want and then more. And over time, you can make it more intelligent. It's serving as this kind of second brain for me where yes, I have all this and part of my superpower as an EA is remembering all these things about people, but this is making sure that it's not all in my head and I can really refresh my memory quickly on all the context rather than diving through the CRM, my email, Slack, and looking at all these things separately. If you are doing a repeated task every week, spend time that week automating that task. I definitely am a believer that AI can only enable us in this role. I think it's a when, not an if. We will have to be folks that adopt these tools. Welcome back to how I AI. I'm Claraveo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today [music] we have Courtney Hickey, EA to the CEO at Zapier. And yes, of course, she uses AI to automate all of the admin tasks related to meetings and document [music] preps and feedback, but she's also going to show us some unique ways that you can use AI to reinforce your cultural values and operating principles. This is a really great one for anybody thinking about organization at scale, operations at scale, and culture at scale. Let's get to [music] it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets automatically. But there's a catch. [music] These tools only work well when they have deep access to company systems. Your co-pilot [music] needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that raises serious security concerns. That's why these apps face intense [music] IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, [music] access controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise features. Building all that from scratch, it's [music] a massive lift. That's where work OS comes in. Work OS gives you [music] drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale [music] up market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, [music] and Cursor are already using work OS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at workos.com. Start building today. Courtney, welcome to How I AI. I am really excited about this episode because I think this is going to be one of the most practical, time-saving, and stressaving episodes of how I AI we have ever had. So, I'm just pumped to have you on. Can you just tell us a little bit about why you've chosen to dive head first into using AI in your role aside from the place that you work? Yeah. So I work for Zapier, which is an automation and AI orchestration company. So of course it's part of our company ethos, but I am just personally super passionate about using AI because I think it can help work myself out of the boring, repetitive, manual parts of my role so I can do more interesting work. And so I truly believe that it's not a if you have to use AI in this type of role, it's a when. So, I like to be ahead of the curve. I like to learn by doing. And so, I've spent as much time as I can over the past couple of years really diving into this and seeing how I can change the shape of my role with this new tech. And what I like is we're going to start off on a workflow and use case that I think everyone can relate to, which is meetings stink. Or not meetings stink, but meetings could be better used in most organizations. They're expensive. You have a lot of people in them. And I think like prep and followup are so valuable and aren't really done well by organizations. So I'd love for you to walk us through a couple of your meeting related workflows. Totally. Yeah. I mean, as an EA, the my life runs off of the calendar. So that was naturally one of the first place I dove into with AI. And so let's jump into one of my favorite workloads that I've built. And this is within Zapier agents. So our agents product uh within Zapier we have a bunch of different products all the way from super deterministic automations that run the same way every time with little creativity to these agents that can do tasks that involve more reasoning and uh have a lot more freedom to operate. So you could build this in a zap, but I wanted to like paint the, you know, change the color of the sky with this agent for myself. So this is an example of one I use personally, but you can replicate this for anyone you work with. But this is essentially my weekly meeting prep agent which on Fridays I used to have maybe let's say 2 hours blocked 30 minutes to like do a retro on that week and anything I need to change but then like spending an hour or so really diving into the next week and what I need to be prepared for. So the way this agent works and it's kind of developed over time but it it has a few steps it goes through and the key thing is this is scheduled to trigger every week. I have it do it at Friday at 8 a.m. So, you can have it whenever. And basically, it goes through my calendar for the upcoming week. It identifies all meetings that require prep. So, personally, I don't need to prep much for team one-on- ones or team standups or recurring internal meetings, but I do have more and more external meetings on my calendar now that I'm doing more out in the world with with AI and automation and teaching folks how to do the same. So, basically, I have it be a bit of a research buddy at first. So, first it just pulls by calendar. Then it goes and does all the research for me. So, this uh takes anyone without a Zap year email and does a a web search basically. It researches their current role, their industry experience, anything um anything noteworthy that I might want to know about them. And then it does this cool thing which also goes and checks in our CRM, which we use HubSpot at Zapier, but you can you can put in any uh you know, of our 8,000 integrations here and and use your CRM. But for each external participant, it goes and then looks at what their relationship is with Zapier. So it looks at email address first, then by company name, figures out what if they're in a deal, if there's any recent sales team notes, if there's any interaction I should know of, and then it also goes and searches internal comm's history. So within my Gmail to see our private prior relationship, if any, within Slack to see if there's any call outs to their company. And so it's it's doing all these things that I would do manually. And then it's delivering me two outputs in the end. So one of them is tasks for my actual prep with all this in it. So I like it to create a task in to-d doist which is my to-do list app with the within a certain project of meeting prep. It pulls in all of this information with this intelligence from the agent and and tells me to prep for it. It puts it on my calendar for 2 hours before the meeting start time. So you can see what that looks like in real life. You know, here here's a couple meetings I have next week and they're automatically cued in my to-do list. But the second thing it does is delivers this weekly digest to Slack. So this is and you could do this day by day too if you have a ton of meetings. But again, I'm I'm mostly internal. So I have it create a structured digest which includes all of the meetings and intelligence. um any error handling I might need to know like if the agent couldn't find someone or if there's anywhere I should do a manual follow-up. And then it does this like pulls its own uses its own creativity to create these insights for me about uh what I should pay most attention to for this upcoming week. So I can pull up a uh real example here. So I just ran this this morning just for this example, but it's going looking at the next week. It's pulling all of the key meetings that require prep preparation. It's saying, \"Okay, so we have a team onboarding with fellow. We're changing our AI note-taking app.\" And so it did some intelligence on who we're meeting with for this. It's confirming that this is a new vendor relationship. We've we've previously purchased this meeting management. They're our implementation specialist. And then, you know, here's here's more context on this. So, it's like it's it's serving at this kind of second brain for me where I yes, I have all this and part of my superpower as an EA is is remembering all these things about people, but this is making sure that I don't it's not all in my head and and I can really refresh my memory quickly on all the context rather than diving through the CRM, my email, Slack and looking at all these things separately. So, one place is is key. And then, um, it pulls in this like key prep recommendations at the end, which is where the agent gets a little bit creative here. So, it's saying I should review my previous carve session. This is a uh, EA automation session I do every once in a while. Tells me to prepare some new demos, tell me to familiarize myself with fellow before the onboarding session, and check with our head of marketing for PR priorities before the agency call. So, I love that it, you know, does exactly what I need to do, like, you know, gives me all these preps in my to-do list and and does those actions, but it also kind of serves as like a double check. Maybe there's something I haven't thought of. Maybe I didn't think I needed to update my deck, and it gives me something new. So, I think what's great about this agent is it does everything you want and then more. And and over time, you can make it more intelligent. So as you as you learn how this works and so I'll give you an example of how this actually works in reality. So this is the test that I pulled right before this call just to give us a clean Slack output. And it walks you through step by step what this agent was thinking. It's like okay I'm testing this. I'm going to go look at the calendar. I'm going to go research all these participants. You can click in and see even more information about what it was thinking. Um, you can see that it went in HubSpot. Couldn't find someone for there. Couldn't find someone who probably didn't have a relationship with them. Oh, great. It found someone. And then, um, it tells you everything it did. So, over time, if if something's not performing as you intended or you want to update it, you can really look at how this agent works on the back end and give it some feedback. And we have this great co-pilot where you can go in and say um you could say like you could go into co-pilot and be like oh uh I actually would love to have a hyperlink to their LinkedIn page included in my to-doist thing. So you can say for each participant, can you also add a LinkedIn hyperlink within the Slack digest? So you can kind of I always tell people when they're starting with an agent like this is progress over perfection. Like I started this one with just a quick digest. It didn't h it didn't have our CRM connected. It didn't have that. And then over time I was like, \"Oh, here's something else that might be helpful.\" And so like build something basic. see how it works, learn, and then it, you know, make time to improve it over time so that you make sure it's really being impactful for you and doing all of the things it can. And, you know, these tools are getting smarter every day. So, also keep on top of, you know, the new new capabilities so you can start building those into agents and and automations and things that you've built in the past. So, that's a quick overview of the agent. Something I want to I want to call out for folks is I think this workflow um highlights a couple strategies that I think people really need to think about. One is I tell people if you are doing a repeated task every week, spend time that week automating that task. And so I um when I had fancy jobs um had an EA as well, we had a very similar process where on Fridays we would actually do a retro of the past week, prep for the next week, find out like all the stuff we needed to prep, make sure that I knew everything that needed to happen. And instead of spending that hour doing that prep on a Friday, I highly recommend people just say this this week I'm gonna spend that hour automate automating this into an agent >> and see if I can replace that flow. And so I think that's a really useful mindset to bring into what and when you can automate. >> Yeah. >> The second thing I would say is I love agents in particular. the sort of like natural language format of describing agents because you can literally just narrate what you would do. You would be like, first I would go and Google and I would look at all the meetings for the next week and I would decide which ones I need to prep uh prep for. Then I would go look at my email and see what the heck we're actually meeting about. Then I would dig through SA Slack. I would probably go look at HubSpot. And then I would, if I was doing a great job, organize it in this way, send it to myself in Slack as a reminder and create a bunch of to-dos. >> Like you can actually use that natural language to describe an agent structure. And so I think it's a really natural way for people to get started designing some of these workflows. Yeah, I agree. Like I think of agents when I first started using them, I I kind of started thinking of them as interns almost. So they're not going to operate and do something completely independently from the start. But if you can teach the intern your system and how you think and give it the tools it needs, then over time your intern gets smart enough to to run and do things on their own. And so, you know, this is something that now I I rarely touch this agent because it works as I as I planned consistently. Um, you know, right now that was a good little ad that I just I just did for the LinkedIn profile, so I can quickly add them. But, you know, there's there's not much else I have to do here. And now I've given myself the time back. And even bigger, I can showcase this to everyone at Zapier, enable them with this template which you can share, and then everyone can have this meeting prep agent. they can, you know, they can add different things if if this isn't their exact workflow, like not everyone uses to-d doist or, you know, not everyone wants XYZ, but they can customize it for their own. And so, I think it's like, yeah, teach teach people how to fish and and teach these interns your your way of thinking, these agents. And over time, you'll be surprised of of how much you can do. I think from EAS, I hear like, oh, you know, AI doesn't think the way I do. I'm like, it can though. like can um as long as you can figure out the system behind why you're doing things and be able to articulate that. But yeah, I I love the like um the dictate to co-pilot too because I do that. I'm like, \"Okay, so usually I talk to it just like that, like as if I'm on a walk with a friend and and see what it comes back with.\" And so, yeah, this is this is like one of those things that's just a no-brainer to spend a little bit of time on and then you it just runs in the background. >> Yeah. And I think you know EAS in particular are so well positioned to make some of these tools for the broader organization because you know you're a point of leverage in a team and if you can systematize that leverage I think two things happen. One you can do a higher level job supporting your exec or your team. two, everybody else gets a little bit of of a boost that you wouldn't be able to personally give them. And so, yeah, >> I think, you know, everybody should think like, oh my gosh, I could have my own little mini, you know, assistant or I could have my own little army of interns if I can just describe what I need them to do. And I think that's really interesting. The last thing I will say is I have a very almost exact workflow in Zapier Agents. It's called my Sunday scaries prep. I do it on Sundays when I start to feel lots of anxiety. >> Yeah. >> Now, um what I'm planning for the next week. And the one ad that I put in here is you can actually mix professional and personal stuff. >> So, I put in there if my mornings allow me to walk my kids to school, block off, you know, this hour to this hour because I know I can like walk the kids to school and by Sunday, if you haven't booked me on an early morning, you don't get me. And so >> like add these little, >> you know, call out days that I don't have time scheduled for lunch. Like call out days where I have six hours of backtobacks with no break. Like give me an opportunity to improve my calendar. So I do think in addition to prep, you can do a little like calendar optimization, too, which is really nice. Totally. I agree. Like yeah, which meetings might be able to combine uh or get rid of that look duplicative? you know, give it give me some recommendations for optimizing my focus time. Like totally the sky's is the limit with with these things. And yeah, you can totally combine personal and professional calendars into this to make it a jack of all trades and do everything. But this one, yeah, this one for me is focus on work, >> you know. And then if you really want hyper efficiency, you just make an agent that says buy all the meetings, cancel all of them, give me my day back. >> Yeah. The the Ron wants an agent. I don't know if you watch Parks and Recreation, but uh April Lgate scheduled all of his meetings for like March 31st one year cuz she didn't think that existed. And then perfect schedule all my meetings for March 31st. You know, you have one other meeting related workflow which I think is really interesting which is making sure that the meetings that you do really are high value. >> Yeah. >> Um so I'd love to for you to walk us through what you do there. Totally. So there's a few things um on the other side of meetings that I do. So one of them is you know this is uh Wade the CEO of Zapier. So I was basically the way this workflow came up was we use Fathom for our meeting note-taking. So I was manually going into fathom after each executive meeting and giving it a prompt like how did we perform against the five dysfunctions of a team which is a framework we use from the table group or who in this meeting could have spoke up more and I was giving it prompts to see how Fathom did with more reasoning and more of a loose like seedback creative prompt versus what were the action items which of course it does excellently and over time I was like this is pretty useful. And so I was manually doing that in Fathom sending it to the exec team and Wade sent me this message. He's like, I feel like we need to turn this meeting coaching on across the org. It's a pretty useful accountability mechanism. I think the other thing here is when feedback is maybe automated uh growth feedback is one of our values. So it's part of how the company runs. that when feedback is expected after a meeting and becomes a part of routine and coaching then folks learn to expect it and it's part of their behavior and it doesn't make their like you know that nervousness spike up when they get feedback come in. So I think the more feedback folks can get the better but I think the other thing this does is takes some spit off the ball. So, uh, so you know, after meetings, I've worked at this team, this exec team for 5 years. So, no one would be offended if I said like, you know, Brandon, you really like should have spoken up on that topic. I can call them out because they've given me the permission to do that. But for folks who are newer to organization or don't have that comfort level with the team, you can build this meeting coaching across the org to and automate it based on any meeting transcript. So, you know, I started working with him uh with uh you know, with Fellow cuz we're moving over to Fellow for AI note-taking and was testing an agent. You know, I was giving Wade, you know, here's an example of the feedback it generated. It gave him speaking time. It gave him, you know, what went well. It gave him opportunities to amplify impact. And then he's like, \"This coaching is too soft. Like, this this is still what went well. Let's have it be tougher.\" So then I gave it, you know, I fixed the agent instructions to give it a better balance of being demanding and supportive, which is a term we use a lot um here at Zapier of like you have to be a demanding leader but you also have to be supportive. So I gave him this one which which did uh did give some more growth opportunities like address misalignment more directly, you know, challenge the decision-m speed. it seems like you have some fear of conflict. And so we worked at that, gave it a more concise version, thought it was good enough to ship. And then so now we've we've shipped this kind of meeting feedback automation system um through through Fellow. But this basically takes all of the transcript content, meeting metadata. Make sure there's some, you know, some parameters like if a meeting is only 10 minutes, probably not worth the feedback. And and make sure it's only zap your employees. make sure there's, you know, only sufficient context to offer valuable specific feedback. And then for each participant, I can look up their Slack, match their email address to Slack, and then send them some, [clears throat] you know, some some feedback. And I gave it context on our company values, you know, some of our meeting norms, you know, how we think about decision-m and then these are impact behaviors for like what we expect from folks at Zapier. And then I gave it the five distinctions of a team. And so I really worked on this prompt over time to help it generate this direct constructive feedback on all these dimensions and then you know you can see uh what the outcome is going to be and this is uh you know clarifies it's AI generated it's coming from a bot gives you know very quick feedback after a meeting of one to two specific growth opportunities and and one to two things they they can do next time. So this is something that I think can over time really just change the way that a team works together and and change the usefulness of a meeting. So this is a maybe not something that was a huge part of my job and I don't calculate this as like a big timesaving agent for myself kind of like the the meeting prep was, but this is something that's like really reinforcing the the company culture and making folks better at their job. So, I think this is it's cool to build stuff like this that's more um that's more just enablement and accountability for folks, especially among the exec teams. So, you make sure that they're being like the best displayers of of company values and norms over time. So, this is a fun one that uh that I had I had a good time creating with Wade. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. [music] Brex is bringing that same power to finance. Brex is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the [music] background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are [music] filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the [music] US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi AI. So Courtney, what I think is great about this is people really think that culture is hard to systematically reinforce. You really think that culture has to be something that individuals or leaders have to carry through sort of soft interactions with the organization. But what you're showing here is more than hey can I give you you know skills coaching on closing a customer or I give you communication coaching on managing stakeholders. This is are we embracing our operating principles, our cultural norms? Are we keeping an eye out for issues in interpersonal conflict or communication that we know teams are biased towards? And are we creating sort of a egoportive system in order to continually check and keep ourselves accountable to that system? And so I think like take the meeting part of this aside, the ability to kind of consistently check interactions and projects and initiatives inside your organization with alignment on your stated cultural norms is a really powerful thing. And you know, you mentioned table group. I've worked with them before and like you get you get them like once a quarter and all this great work for your leaders and you're like yeah we're going to like be the best team we're totally aligned >> giving everybody feedback but they're not whispering in your ear during the executive me I mean I'm sure they would for a price but during your executive meetings you know they're not listening into your company you know town halls or amas and so I think this is just such a nice way to observe your organization from a third party kind of like vantage point. >> Yeah. >> And then as you said like just normalize feedback. This is very stressful feedback for people to receive maybe from their boss. >> Yeah. >> Like hey you didn't do this or you didn't do that. But if you know everybody in the meeting is getting feedback. It's coming from sort of a neutral evaluation place. Then you might be more open to hearing and kind of adjusting your your behaviors based on that feedback. Yeah, totally. I think I think you hit the nail on the head with with a few of the main reasons why I like this. I think it's are we who we say we are? You know, are are you who you say the are we what we say our culture is? And and are we keeping that top of mind in between things like, you know, we're a fully remote company. We do only meet with table group once a quarter, once a half. And so, we need to keep these behaviors top of mind consistently and folks have a hard time keeping anything top of mind for that long. And so making sure this is repetitive and continuing to reinforce those things is valuable. But yeah, we've I mean we've got the other type of agent for, you know, sales reps, for example, that gives them after gone calls what they could have done that's more like, okay, you should have brought up this ROI or this metric or, you know, more specific sales coaching. But >> I I love the the culture stuff. >> Okay, this is great. So we have um schedule prep, we have culture checkpoints, which I think are awesome. But let's answer the question with AI that I'm not saying every IC manager and leader in the organization thinks about a lot but they might which is will this fly with CEO or will this fly with executive A or how do I know I'm not walking into into a tough meeting. So, you've done you've done some work to sort of stress test what your CEO might want or participate in without having to bother him. So, I'd love to see your sort of exec replicate uh workflows. >> Totally. So yeah, again on the meeting side, but this is a GPT I built within OpenAI's tribute and it's we have this public feed in Slack which is feed t-ups which are basically any strategic doc that need review across the company. We've kind of centralized this in a feed for transparency, accountability, and make sure folks know why we're making certain decisions. And so the folks were often coming to me for thought partnership of like, hey, here's my doc. Do you have any feedback on it before I share this with Exec, you know, you know how Wade thinks. You've worked with them for 5 years. What would you think about this? And I love doing that thought partnership stuff and I don't want to replace it, but again, it's not scalable and I don't want to be a bottleneck for someone to get their doc out into the world. And so I built a GPT that kind of thinks like like I do and and has some of the same materials of like company values and and norms, but it helps people sharpen these teaups. And so sometimes it makes sure that, you know, folks come into a meeting with more confidence and their opinions are stress tested and the right data is included and make sure we make the most of those meetings that we're in. But sometimes the teaup is so clear uh now that we can skip the meeting entirely, which is great as well. So you can see here like, you know, Wade said he he tried it out, caught several things that would strengthen the work. We've got, you know, Lindsay saying, \"I was worried it would just tear my doc apart, but it suggested really great simple tweaks.\" And so we gave it a bunch of knowledge. So I I'll dive into that right now. So um this is exact GBT. Um I gave it a prompt here to say give feedback on a t-up doc, which was one of the main prompts considered. And I created a fake doc which is a very very poor teaup just to give an example for this. Um so this was a teaup that basically I just said create a really bad EAP doc. Um so this this is like you know gives a really loose purpose. It you know doesn't have an approver. It's like >> just something we've been thinking about. Doesn't have much background. So it's it's a bad doc. So it's not but it's not going to give you the the most exciting feedback. But it goes in and again like takes the spit off the ball of feedback and helps people uh you know get more confident. But this is saying you know this reads more like a jam session than a tea up. You will get better feedback if you clarify these things. Let's tighten it up. And so it gives a quick read of what you have. Gives feedback on how to strengthen it to surface trade-offs. Add a recommendation. And then, you know, it gives an example rewrite even in this case because the doc was so loose on on details, but it gives, you know, a couple top fixes before the bullpen and then which is what we call these kind of tea meetings and then one bold coaching question. So, I I love uh that it does this and even gives you a suggested next step like let's let's give a tight Wade style one-page rewrite of this so it's bullpen ready. So, uh, I love that. And this, uh, this GPT is built off of the back of I'll dive into it really quick, but it's built off the back of, uh, you know, again, our team norms, our revenue roadmap, our strategy memo, good examples of T-ups, you know, Wade feedback tuning, a managing of to Wade dock. So it gives like all of this context on the back end that can help simulate people's feedback again to make sure they're sharper, clearer, and better at unlocking decisions. So uh I love this one because it's again just helps enable everyone at Zapier. I love when the things that I build don't only help me but then can have these kind of ripple effects within the organization. I think that's how you can become really an AI champion and transform your org is by starting with your own wins. you know, start with your own meeting prep or whatever, but then be like, okay, how can I enable the next set of folks on this? How can we meet this like world orwide? And so, I love that. I love that this is really something anybody can use, you know, on the I I created in chat to BT for many reasons, but one of them being that I don't have context to the conversation, so folks can really feel comfortable putting all of their information in there and making sure that, you know, no one's on the back end like reviewing it. Um, I think we can see the I think we can see some analytics here on, you know, 278 people have have used this to sharpen a strategy doc. So again, it feeds back into things like my impact reviews and showing that I'm enabling the whole org. So, I I love this one as well for just making sure our meetings are more efficient, making sure I'm not a bottleneck. And then I can still provide my coaching where where it makes sense and I can still have those people where I'm thought partnering on with their docs, but this helps me scale me basically and scale the exacts before it gets to a meeting. >> Yeah. And what I would say is people also love when you come to an exact meeting or a feedback session where you say, \"I've already checked it against our strategy or I've already tried to do a loop of this with this GBT.\" Like just that extra effort to go through an independent loop before taking synchronous time to get feedback is both probably improving the quality of your work, but also just saving people time and it people really appreciate it. So I think that sort of initiative is also useful. And what I want to go to for our last use case is really you've extended strategic thinking through through the organization with another tool. So I'd love to see kind of our last um strategic alignment tool that you've built using AI because I think it's a really neat one. Yeah. So one thing we we just launched about a month ago is in notebook LM. So this is uh enabled through through Google and uh this is like the announcement we made in Slack to give you uh a high view of of why we did this and what it is. But it's basically a strategy companion which uh we know that folks have a hard time looking at this big picture strategy work sometimes and then saying okay how does that impact me? And sometimes it's just hard to find the answers you're looking for within all these different strategy docs all hands meetings. And so we gave folks this basically knowledge base here. Here here's a screenshot of it of of what these look like in reality. I just, you know, cleared out the summary of our strategy [clears throat] to make sure I'm not like, you know, totally revealing everything here. But what's great is that we can continue to add sources over time. So you can see we've got a few dozen sources in here which are everything from the top level strategy doc to all hands we've had to transcripts from other meetings we've had around strategy to every org's strategic action plan and so folks can go and interact with these but they can also interact with this in a chat capacity and ask it anything they want. So here's an example of it in in real life. Uh, so you know, I'm saying I just gave it a simple prompt of as an executive assistant, how can I contribute to Zapier's 2026 strategy? And it's saying, \"Oh, that's a great question. We I think you can help with champion clarity, focus, and speed. Make sure we're spending time on the right priorities. You know, make sure that you're driving internal AI transformation.\" And so, I love that it gives me, you know, some of that and and connects back to the sources. But there's also fun things here like this uh it autogenerates a podcast. So I don't know if I'm fully sharing my computer sound here, but I'll play it for a couple of seconds. This is fully AI generated just based off of the back of these sources. So it talks like this. >> Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're uh really giving you the essential shortcut here. Absolute alignment on the strategy. >> We're pulling the core ideas straight from the Zap year 2026. And all of this is AI generated of of things you can create. So it really helps make the strategy interactive instead of a static doc and static thing and helps folks get their questions answered again before going to their leader or going to someone in their org. And so I love this for just enabling folks to be able to connect their work and be able to query this over time. And it's something that we can keep updated and and make sure that it has the most recent information so everyone can can get value out of it. So Courtney, I love these use cases. What I keep reflecting on is people are like, \"Oh, EA's EAS are going to go in this age of AI.\" And I'm like, \"Have you worked with a fabulous EA?\" Because the second they automate one task, they figure out 10 more that are so high leverage for the organization. culture carrying behaviors, strategic like communication, operational efficiency, like you are just demonstrating that this can happen at a next level. And so, zooming back out, what we saw today was everything from helping yourself dig dig out of a busy calendar with meeting prep to enforcing your cultural goals and leadership norms through always on feedback, checking feedback ahead of a synchronous meeting so you can make sure it's aligned with both how executives want to receive it, but also kind of the important business initiatives and goals of the company. And then finally, how you can take all this content that's always I mean, I just don't know an organization that is not consistently writing strategy documents, just one strategy document to the next, big strategy document, little strategy document, strategy update, strategy goals. And so just creating a purpose-built repository for that information that can then be accessed in a multimodal way for people to learn, align their work, be educated, all that kind of stuff. I think is super awesome. So these were really, really great workflows. We're going to do quick lightning round and then we will get you out of here. I think the first thing is kind of this thing I I said which is a lot of people think your role is going away or they're afraid of AI um taking over this role and I think you're showing actually you're just becoming so much higher leverage and have to be having so much more fun. So tell me how do you respond to to that feedback around AI and in particular the kind of EA role? I definitely am a believer that AI can only enable us in this role. I think it's a when, not an if. We will have to be folks that adopt these tools. There is simply too much to do. I think there's the one of the biggest problems that EAs have is we always have more work that we want to do than we have time for. And so that's what it's consistently hearing, I don't have enough time. I don't have enough time. Like this is how we can do that. And I I mean to I don't like talking about myself very much, but to humble brag and tie this back to Real Impact, I've I've gotten three promotions since I've been here and been able to work myself out of multiple roles and, you know, I think that this is how you can do that. you can be this really great AI partner for your company and make sure that you're at the forefront and take all that busy manual repetitive work off your plate so you can be do the human stuff, the fun stuff, the stuff you like to do, the stuff that's creative, um, and and relationship driven and those things that we wish we had time for. And so I think that it's just it's such an exciting thing for our role and I don't think it's going to take our jobs. There may be you know certain admin things it does take eventually but it's not going to take the whole thing. Think about the scope of what we do. Our whole job is to be you know all wide across the org and a little bit of depth in each area. But now you can be wide across the or have more depth and have more time for for projects and special things that you can do for your team. >> Okay. So speaking of special things, you have been one of the people I think is closest to answering this question which is how close do you think we are to replicating executives? How happy is Wade with your AI versions of him? And do you think we're actually working towards a world where those get quite high fidelity relative to individuals preferences, feedback, thought process, communication process? Yeah, it's a great question. I think there are certain parts where we're getting kind of close on. So over time, you know, I used to think of myself as a clone of Wade in certain instances. I could write coms like him. I could run his schedule. I could do things like him. And now we've we've got a clone of AI tools that are helping me do things like him, too. So, there's certain parts of of what he thinks and does that we're pretty close to replicating with these AI tools. What I'm not sure of is Wade or any exec. Um, but speaking just for Wade here, he's a constant learner. He is he is ingesting so much information, learning new things, trying new things, building every day like hands on keyboard. like the amount uh he can grow and learn like the pace of that is so high that I wonder how you could keep these models up to date with that because >> like I you know I know they they update fast but like how can you how can you grow at at the pace of of someone's brain and and how your evolving does change your thought process does change over time so there's things old things in Zapier history where someone's like oh I heard Wade said we'll never do XYZ and you're like that was an old decision. That was an old decision. Like I have so much new context that's changing the way I think. And so for a leader who's constantly adapting, changing the way they think and using new information to help them make smarter decisions. How do you how do you replicate that part of it? I don't know. There's things that but the consistent side like how he writes internal memos or you know how he writes certain things are we're pretty close to replicating. [laughter] Okay. And then final question. When um AI Wade is not replying to you the way you want or you're not getting what you need out of a specific prompt, what is your prompting technique? Do you are you all an all caps girl? Do you what do you what do you do here? O I am not an all caps girl. I'm a ramble. So I love the dictate feature and I love to talk to it and I give it feedback very very direct. I'm just very direct as a person and and demanding and so I do that. I'm like, I don't understand why you're doing it this way. Show me a reasoning of why you did it that way because I told you to do this and this is what I'd like to see and here's the feedback I have. And I just ramble and give it, you know, everything I'm thinking. I think folks like sometimes don't know where to start and and try to give it this very specific feedback and write it. No, just like give it top of mind, pretend it's someone with no feelings and be demanding. So, I don't know. Hopefully the AI robots don't come for me. I do think people can thank you sometimes. So, Good, good, good. AI, >> AI, we uh we we we know you have feelings. I don't know. We'll see [laughter] what happens in 10 years. >> Yeah. Um Okay, Courtney, this has been so great. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? Yeah. So, uh feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. I love posting about additional use cases, things I'm building, workshops we're having. But I' I'd love for y'all to check out this EA Exec Ops AI playbook I just made recently, which has like, you know, six different categories of things that the EAS do consistently and different ways we've we've automated that and ways that folks can replicate it and give me feedback on it. I'd love to I'd love to hear what we're missing, what we can build out more. I'm looking for new things to build all the time, so I love I love getting feedback from the community on what would be helpful. >> Awesome.

    "transcript": "We're going to start with something that we haven't actually seen on how I AI yet, which is agent mode in chat GBT. >> My use case was with our hiring team. Part of their workflow is to browse through many LinkedIn profile and search for relevant candidates. It takes a lot of time. >> Let's talk about the prompt. I'd love for you to go through how you thought about structuring it to make it effective with the agent. >> I want a little helper. I'm a recruiter. I want someone who is like me. So, I started by telling it you're an ID recruiter. And then I described what I wanted to do. I love that you called it your little helper because don't we all want an AI little helper? [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Clarva, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have Mihal Pled [music] from Honeybook, their technical operations engineer who's building tons of internal tools and automations to [music] make their team's life easier and reduce friction. Miha is going to show us some advanced features of Chat GBT, including agent mode, replicate not one but five of their personas as AI identities, and save me a lot of time on my commute using Chat GBT. I'm really excited about this episode. Let's [music] get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know [music] AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. Brex is bringing that same power to finance.

One in three startups in the [music] US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi ai. Mihal, thank you so much for joining How I AI. I'm excited to see what you have to share. >> Thank you so much for having me. >> We're gonna start with something that we haven't actually seen on how I AI yet, which is agent mode in chat GBT. And so I'm wondering if you can just go ahead and dive into what was the problem that you were trying to solve and why was this agent mode, this agentic browsing the solution to the problem you're having? Our problem was um you know same as same as our customers are having. Uh you have to do your job. You have a job that you really love doing and you have your proficiencies and and expertise. However, you spend a lot of your time doing the the um mundane thoughtless uh manual repeating work in order to do uh to get the information that you need. So my use case was with our hiring team and as a recruiter when you get a job description that you need to recruit to find candidates for part of their part of their uh workflow is to uh browse through uh many LinkedIn profile and search for uh relevant candidates that may be uh relevant for the job descriptions and it takes a lot of time can be hours of browsing through profiles and going through all of the characteristics that they're looking for. So I wanted to take that load off of them and uh Chad GPT agent mode came just in time. We all talk about what agent is and what agents do and how we can use them in chat. It's very uh simple to understand. So you just open a chat with chatgpt but then you add an instruction and turn it into an agent mode very simply from the toolbar. And once it goes into agent mode, it means that it can take the prompt or you can actually use specific prompts to tell it not just to search for information online but also to perform actions for you. And why did I need it in this case? Because I needed to log into LinkedIn. I don't want it to just search for profiles uh on LinkedIn just just profiles that are publicly accessible. That's not the information that I need. So, I needed it to log into LinkedIn and I needed it to perform search and I needed it to go through the profiles and and look for the restrictions that I want to give it. And those restrictions were provided by the actual uh hiring team that they actually use it as uh requirements for potential candidates that they find. >> Yeah. Let's talk about the the prompt really quickly because I think this prompt is is interesting as I'm reading it. And I'd love for you to go through how you thought about structuring it to make it effective with the agent. >> Of course. So I usually start my prompts uh begin my prompts with telling the GPT its role. And so here I told it you are an IT recruiter. I want a little helper, right? I'm a recruiter. I want someone who is like me that will will assist me with my job. So I started by telling it you're an ID recruiter. And then I described what I wanted to do, what the task is. Log to LinkedIn using my account. If not already logged in, let me take control and log in. It is something that is possible. Find up to five LinkedIn profiles where the current title and job description match the attached job description. Uh and here is the part where I just uploaded uh job description. In this case, it's for an engineering role. Okay. Um so I have the job description and I have the um uh you are an IT recruiter. This is your job. This is the task and I provide like a full description of the task actually actually describing what an actual IT recruiter would do and then I added restrictions or special instructions. It doesn't matter matter how you call them but these are important because these give don't just search for something that matches the description. Do it the way that we do it. And when our hiring team goes into a search, they have specific criteria that they go for. So I collected these and and I added it as a list as a restriction. I could call it instructions. It would would have been the same. So candidates must be from Israel because the job is being filled up in Israel or currently working at an Israeli company and they must be active in LinkedIn uh within the last 3 months because that's something that our hiring team is looking for. uh and the current job role must be close enough to the uh open role and in title and seniority and uh also something that is special uh the candidates must either work in their current workspace more than a year or they can be unemployed but no more than a year uh and have worked in their last workplace for over a year. These are all things, but I I didn't invent them. They were taken specifically from our iron process. >> What I love about this is exactly what you said, which is I first I love that you called it your little helper because don't we all want an AI little helper? That is that is my goal. Maybe I'll rebrand my product to just little helper. Um, but what I like about this is, you know, it when you're building a a tool like this or a prompt like this, the simplest way to get to a good outcome is simply interview somebody and say step by step, just tell me what you do. Like, tell me what you do. And if you can codify what a person's step-by-step workflow is and you can put that into a pretty simple prompt, which here it's only a paragraph and, you know, three or four bullet points, you can replicate and automate that at scale. And typically, this is not the highest order thinking you want your recruiter or sourcer to do. You don't want them just to build a list and be looking is this person here a year or not. that is an input to what you hope is a great recruiting process, great outreach, all that kind of stuff. So, one, I think it's just really great to interview your colleagues and say, \"How do you do your job and what parts do you hate and let me automate them?\" The second piece that I think is really interesting here is you're actually pretty specific about a couple outcomes. You're specific about the number of candidates that you want. So, I think that's really helpful. you're specific about a kind of um threshold of matching your criteria. So you say 70% and I often find these LLMs are very you know what is 70% matching like it's not it's not pure science but they're pretty good at at following a general threshold. So I think that is really interesting. And then the last piece I want to call out which we'll maybe see in the demo is agent while it can be agentic and independent can also be a co-pilot and collaborator. And so you actually instruct the agent when you're going to take over and when they're going to take over. And so I think that is also really interesting things for folks to know is you don't just have to like press the button and walk away and let the agent run. You can press the button and say, \"Hey, wait. When you get to this point, let me take the next step.\" And then you can go on from there. So, that's really interesting. >> Exactly. Or if you encounter a problem with this and that, stop and ask for my assistant. Um, and that's exactly the agent. That's exactly the agent mode. Thinking about it as uh a little helper will really help you come up with good prompts for it. >> Okay. Okay. I think you gave us our our show title will be >> Chad GBT agent mode your little helper. So let's see how it runs. >> Exactly. Exactly. Um so once you start running it and it's this is something that is mind-blowing for anyone who who tries it for the first time even the ones who are you know very proficient with using AI tools. Suddenly you get like a computer. Open it up in in your you know you see you you see your uh your your little helper actually doing things in the computer. So it start it started by reading my job description and then you can see it goes it it it will try to go to LinkedIn. It will probably be already logged in because I logged in beforehand. And uh the thing I like the most you see is it's logged in and then you can see like the arrow goes and clicks on things and searches on things and go through the list. And the thing I like the most is is that during all of this time you can see the thoughts of the agent. Now I will go to uh the feed page loaded again. I plan to click on first I need to make sure like you can see inside the brain of your agent while it is thinking and so uh and all of this is live. So I will let it run here but we can go and see uh results. Yeah, you know, I I want to call out a couple things because I know that often on how I AI, we have highly technical use cases for highly technical folks, but we also have a lot of people that are actually quite new to using generative AI tools and have probably been pretty familiar with ChatGBT and the direct experience. But I know if I showed my mom this or um even some of my friends that maybe don't work in tech and said, \"Hey, did you know that Chad GBT can open up a magic computer and navigate it and narrate its thoughts and look for things for you?\" They'd be pretty pretty surprised. And I think, you know, as you watch this, what I hope our listeners and viewers are taking away is you don't just have to rely on text prompts and chats when you're using these tools. Now that the next kind of like evolution of these LLMs, especially the more like consumer focused general purpose ones like Chad GPT have evolved, you actually have a lot more tools. And so I just want to call out so for some of those folks um out there I'm you know I'm thinking a little bit of of my parents and some people in an older generation who are like how do I get from here to here or I need help you know searching for flights or I need to do a certain kind of research on a niche site. Having sort of this expert computer operator on hand, I actually think is going to make um information more accessible to folks, but it's also going to make UX and websites more accessible to folks that don't have the time to figure out how do I use the best filters on LinkedIn or those sorts of things. And so I just I want to make sure that people that have not experienced agent mode and I know we're all on the edge so maybe all of us have just you know take a minute to appreciate the kind of use cases that this opens up. Also it's just fascinating to watch. >> Yeah. >> AI operating >> of course first time I I tried it I just sat and watched the thoughts of the agent while it was thinking. Going to our more technical audience though, a couple things that I want to call out is one, props to the OpenAI chat GBT team. What a great user experience design here. Like it could feel very strange to watch uh an agent browse a website. It could either be boring or weird. And I think this um user experience of like being able to see where the cursor is, showing the reasoning and thoughts, watching it navigate is actually pretty entertaining. That's a hard thing to pull off for a a consumer product. And so for anybody designing AI products, it's worth thinking about some of these interaction patterns here. And then again, I just think about how long this would take someone to do. We're watching it because I'm trying to narrate some of the features, but you know, you could you could walk away. You could go to a meeting while this happens or do something something else. If you have Chad GPT on your phone, you will get notification and notification when it's done to tell you that it's done and and here are the results for you. We said little helper. >> And the last thing I'll call out, I love I really do love this use case is I do this specific thing all the time as a hiring manager, executive leader in an organization. I was constantly looking for like who's a senior director of DevOps and platform infra who is either in San Francisco or works for a San Francisco based company who has experience in dev tools that you know one one change I would maybe make on your prompt is like is one or two connections away so I can actually message them or get a a back channel reference on that. I did this all the time. I had my hiring managers do this all the time. So even if you're not in recruiting and you're just somebody who does hiring, I think this specific workflow is really really useful. >> Yeah, definitely. Uh that's an excellent use case that you you just mentioned. >> So let's actually um let's look at the output. We'll we'll let this run, but I know you have an example output for us. >> Yeah. Yeah, it runs. I have an output that actually uh worked for 10 minutes just that. And within these 10 minutes, I got a list of five candidates as I requested for. And you can see the match score. Well, having a mesh score or rank for a result is something that I really love doing. It's not a must but if you give uh specific if you provide specific requirements and ask for a match score it is easier to understand what uh results are more have more quality for you. I mean otherwise you could just get a table of like these are the five results but is someone of them better or maybe a better match for what I need than the others? I won't be able to see it unless I instruct the the GPT to provide me with some score. So it's not um an exact science but it does give you some kind a way to compare between the results. So I will say someone who got 90% um match is probably as as like probably will be a better match than the 78% match. And I will have to go deeper and understand why. >> Yeah. One of I I'll call out a couple things here that I think are for interesting for people to look like. I know we were talking before the show. You actually made this anonymized data just so we weren't showing people's profiles or, you know, showing how person A versus person B >> fit a specific job you're hiring for. But I will say anonymizing candidate profiles is actually a pretty standard practice in a lot of recruiting flows just to make sure you're not biased. this school, that school, this person, that person, this name, that name. And so I actually kind of like this flow where you're really just comparing the qualifications against your stated objections or objectives. And so I think that is a really interesting kind of metaplow that you're showing here. The second thing that I wanted to say as I was reflecting back on agent mode is it's almost exactly like a recruiter or sorcerer would navigate LinkedIn except for one thing. When I log into to LinkedIn, I don't go straight to the job to be done. I don't go straight to that search bar and search for like VPs of engineering. No, no, >> I get distracted by the by the notification. I start reading the feed. I'm responding to comments. I go through my inbox. And so I think like why is it 10 minutes? It's 10 minutes because it's like pretty hyper hyperfocused and efficient, but it's also 10 minutes because you're not getting so distracted with all the other things in in the application and you can really just get the agent to focus on the task task at hand. So, um, maybe it's a way for us to all break I sorry LinkedIn LinkedIn growth PMs, I apologize, but a good way for us to still get the value of these platforms without getting our time sucked into the um less value generating aspects of them maybe. >> Yeah, that is correct. >> So, tell me a little bit about how this was received by the team. I'd love to know the kind of outcomes here. Yeah. Well, I I I will be real and say that on like the first result that I got, I was very skeptic about. So, I just took the the table and I sent it to our hiring manager and I told her this is the job description. This is what AI found for me uh in LinkedIn. If you can go through the results and let me give me feedback. Are there good results? are we familiar with these candidates? Did we try to reach out to them or uh you're looking at them and say, \"Oh, no. That's a terrible fit. I don't know why why why this person is even in this table.\" Um, and so she went over over them. You can see that the table has links to the direct like the the LinkedIn profile per candidate. So she scanned those five profile and she came back to me and she said, \"Well, uh, you know what? Out of these five, four of them were never found by us manually and they really fit the description. So we would want to approach and and you know try try to get them to uh to come for an interview.\" And the fifth one was actually one that we caught manually and is already coming for an an interview. Uh and so to me it was a great sign for quality. I mean it's not just a list of names. Those are actual real quality candidates that we can work with. And so now now they want they want the agent to run on a lot more uh job description many more job descriptions that we have provide them with more than five candidates. I wanted just five to see if if it if it's worth something. Um, yeah, but now it's going to be a real part of of their hiring process, freeing their their time to do other things that they love and appreciate a lot more. Yeah. And I can't emphasize what you're saying enough because so many people push back on AI saying, \"Yeah, you may get speed and you may get efficiency, but you're not getting quality.\" And my experience has has been the opposite of that. you get speed and you get quality. And again, it's those it's that last mile, those edge cases, those ones that are like just a little hard to find, a little hard to research where I think AI can increase the quality um of that of that last bit. And so it was it's amazing to see that this work for your recruiting has given me so many ideas, not you know, not just the recruiting um use cases, but just in general one people finding use cases. I was thinking about how you could find great candidates or customers on like X or LinkedIn. And then the other thing that I think is is really great here is just showing we don't get a lot of um GNA functions. We don't get a lot of people functions getting love in how I AI. I feel like all the noise is about like product design, engineering support. And so I just love seeing the recruiters get some love here because you're the people that bring in great talent and fun colleagues to work with. So, thank you for showing this. >> This podcast is supported by Google. Hey everyone, Shishta here from Google Deep Mind.

And 2.5 Flash Light is ideal for low latency, high volume tasks. Start building in Google AI Studio at ai.dev. >> Let's zip to your second use case, which I think is really we we're going from finding real people to creating fake people. So, I'm excited [laughter] excited about this this workflow. >> That's an excellent description of it. >> Um so, uh let me ask you that. Um, imagine you're a business owner and imagine being able to talk to uh thousands of your potential customers all at once and gather their insights on your planned ad campaigns, planned features, product experience, all from your phone or tablet 24-hour a day with one click of a button. Actually talk to actually talk to them. I I I thought it's mind-blowing. And so it started with um HoneyBook um invested in a comprehensive customer research with a third-party provider who interviewed hundreds of our target small business owners and they created five detailed buyer personas. But the research was trapped in documents, hundreds of pages of insights that teams rarely referenced because it was too time consuming to extract actionable information when making product or marketing decisions. So the end goal was we have five personas. We want to talk to them. Let's create a chat GPT that is that person, that actual person. And so I started with and here that there are some technical takeaways but here I want to put the the spotlight on the thinking process because it's very easy to go to Chad GPT and everyone with a subscription tier of um um it's not the a plus a plus subscription tier and above can create uh their own custom GP and so you go to create a custom jet GPT. It's quite it's a quite simple process. You add a name to your GPT, a description, but the most important parts are the instructions you're providing it with and the files that you can upload as a knowledge for that uh chat that you're talking to. So, I needed five like them. But first, I thought, okay, this is all I this is all I know about custom chat GPTs. I can basically take all of the documentation from the interview and just upload all of the files, text files, presentations, whatever into this uh custom chatbot, provide it with some instructions or on how to answer, what the research was about, what to say, what not to say, and ask it questions about the research itself. But that's not what I wanted. So I was like, okay, if I'm taking just the files per persona. So I'll concentrate in one persona, take the files related to that persona, upload it to the chat, instruct the the the chat what that persona is, how to read the files, what's included in the files. Then I'll be able to maybe ask about that persona and I will probably get answers like that persona would have done this or that persona would prefer that but it's not like talking to the persona. I'm still talking about the persona and and not with it. And so I I I realized I'm not going to rely on uploaded files for the chat GPT. I need the instructions to be the the main and most important part of what consists of that persona. And the instructions here will not be what's in a file or talking about someone else. There will be exact instructions that goes that that go like you are that person and this is your belief system and this is how you run your business and this is how you deal with media and uh this is how you deal with technology and everything has to be super super super tight. So that chat GPT once running live will actually become that persona that can answer based on what it knows about itself, not files that are attached to it. And so I needed to uh bridge that gap. I have all of the research there. I need a a I need to make a person out of it or five five of them actually. Okay. So >> okay, so you heard it here first. This is our first how AI where we are manufacturing not one, not two, not three, not four but five people. So show us the process. Yeah. So I thought about it and then I decided to go to another tool that I really like. This is notebook LM. Uh it's a Google it's a Google's tool and notebook LM the thing I like about it the most and the reason I picked that tool in order to uh construct the the the instructions or the prompt per persona is uh actually there are several reasons but one of them is notebookm allows you to upload your own sources and can answer al based on these sources and not things that it goes and finds online or thinks or knows or filling in the gap. This is the information you ask me about something I will answer based on the knowledge that you provided alone. Also, it allows you to check and uncheck the uh sources that you want to rely on. So I can ask a question without relying on the buyer journeys for example and then the answer will not include that that part of the knowledge things that I cannot do in chat juby or anything else um and then uh there's this chat part within the notebook where it's it's a it's Gemini based uh Gemini is Google um chat model okay and and in this uh chat window I prompted the chat uh again you are an expert prompt engineer again with a role what you are specializing in creating custom GPTs by providing strong AI prompts and then the mission what your task or mission is uh your mission is to create AI prompts for custom GPS representing entrepreneurs and small business owners who are the decision makers and on so you will craft highly detailed nuance and authentic Chad GPT prompts for five distinct buyer personas based on your sources. I never told it what were the personas. It had to get it from the sources and that's uh the the most important part again is guidelines. I mean prompts are nice. It it usually they usually should come with some guidelines, instructions, um anything that you want to be to uh the chat to take specific care of. So in my case, the guidelines were uh to ensure that the prompt correctly and fully describe the core identity, mindset, decision making style. I didn't want the chat to decide uh on itself what what I care for about those personas because I knew what I care for. So I wanted their mindset and decision-m style and tone and communication style and then um the business needs and the technology stack and the journey map, social media preferences. I I pointed the chat to exactly what I needed to get out of this research. And then that's another important one. I think one should not go on without that instruction. Don't add or modify text that is not written or implied in the text. Okay. I know you're creating. I'm turning you down. The text describe a specific persona must remain true to the original persona. Yeah, >> I'm laughing because yesterday I literally wrote a prompt that was like do not make up any links and I had a thing that was making do not make any up any links that are not in your source of links like and it and it's so funny. We get so used to operating these chat bots as if they have human reasoning and sometimes they have kind of like superhuman reasoning and sometimes they just do stuff that a human would never do like just make up something. And so I think this third prompt, we'll zoom in on it on the show, uh, is probably applicable to a lot of things, especially when you're trying to constrain um, an LLM space to a specific set of of of data and and inputs. So it's a it's a good prompt. Everybody should use the don't make up stuff prompt. Your hallucination rate will drop [laughter] now. >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Wow. It it is very it is crucial to add those things and to think about them. >> Y >> yeah. Um so the result was and um another thing that notebook LM is good at doing is you can uh save the responses of the chat as notes and those notes are saved here for you to look at later. So I can show you an example of the notes that it created. But mainly you I just took the prompts. I went over them. Uh the important thing about the prompts is that's another uh strength of using Notebook LM. It uses um it uses citations. So you can actually go over um a piece of information that the chat decided this persona is and see where did you take it from and and just make sure and verify that it went through all of your uh data information and didn't invent anything. >> I'm going to laugh because I'm from Austin and I'm pretty sure I know people pleaser whatever Parker. Um, so this seems like a very accurate Austin entrepreneur persona if folks are wondering if this is creating high quality high quality persona promps. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> So eventually Yeah. I I what I did is just I took the prompts. I did need to refine them a little. Okay. because um even with all of my instructions, Gemini didn't exactly uh realize what kind of prompt it needs to create. So, it was missing some guard rails. It was a little too long. Uh the chat GP the custom GPT uh instructions are limited to 8,000 characters and it created some of the prompts being longer than that. So I did need to deal to do a little refine and create uh stronger prompts. So for example, and I'll show you here in the demo, I needed to add I used CHPK itself or sometimes claude because I like working with claude. Um I used them just to uh tighten the the instructions a little and make it more robust and add guard rails. So, I added for example um you do not act as a general person per purpose assistant. You do not ask follow-up questions. You avoid slang, bad language, or dis distasteful content. And keep communication respectful and inspiring. You avoid political, religious, gender, or racial commentary. And I really wanted to add it. That's another key point for creating custom GPTs that need to talk as a person because believe me those people work with you. They are your friends. The first thing they will try with a TED GPT like persona is to tackle them with swear words or their [laughter] their uh ideas about political things or um I don't know >> for uh for food. So >> this this maybe should be a default prompt wrapper on all enterprise GPTs and it would save us all a lot of a lot of heartache. >> Yeah. So you can see it uh it's in order of what I asked for. So core identity, mindset, business needs, uh technology stack, whatever. And then what you get is then it's the time to actually test them. So we created those five and I can go to balance blake. You can see uh she's one of the most talked to internal chats. So, we can go to balance blick and I can ask her um what kind of edline would catch your attention. Maybe I'll move it. Would catch your attention during a busy work day. Don't you? Why didn't you want to know the that thing about your uh ideal or prospect client? And I can I can send her the question and then if I'm scanning quickly between meetings or uh juggling uh a few would catch my eye. Save 10 hours a week with this tool. No tech skills needed or from key from chaos to clarity. one dashboard to run it all. Your clients don't need another email. They need this. And this persona actually explains why even why every one of these headlines will catch their attention. And I can take the same thing and try it on a completely different persona like Aiden and Aiden will give me complete different answer. Aen will say, \"I need one that respects my time and speaks directly to the pain I'm feeling in that moment. Still doing admin during edited days. Ears are to reclaim 5 hours a week.\" Other variations that might grade me, win better clients without burning out, and so on and so on. So each persona actually answers based on the persona that we got from research. And that single persona represents thousands of potential customers. And so you can try add headlines or you can try uh a product journey. What would be your your best first impression when you get into a new CRM? um uh what would be the feature that will uh convince you not to churn a CRM. So you can try it on them. They are 247 ready to talk to you on whatever. And I I really like them. I mean personalizing those personas has changed the way we work with them. >> I just love this workflow. And to recap it for folks, you took a bunch of I'm presuming pretty expensive research that probably sat in a bunch of PDFs and docs where you know we occasionally said head down hayden but otherwise did not use these personas. Use notebook LLM to create a prompt that embodied the personality of the persona. You put those personas in GBTs and now you can see that dozens of times your colleagues have gone to them to brainstorm with the persona which I think is really interesting and it's giving me a lot of ideas. So many people go to just plain chaty people it's like give me five headlines for an ad campaign as opposed to going and sitting with you know sitting with your fake persona and saying what what what ad campaigns would work on you. So I love this flow. We learned a little bit about the strengths of notebook LM uh GPTs and flipping these like sort of personas on their head. Let's go to workflow 3 which I will tell you I personally I have a personal connection to. So people in San Francisco listen here's the use case for you. Let's jump to your last use case and then we can get you out of here. >> Well this one is actually yeah a a really big pain. So yeah, [laughter] favorite your soul. Um well, imagine getting ready in the morning, driving to work, uh already planning ads for your busy schedule and morning routine only to discover that parking in your favorite parking in your favorite parking lot now costs $40 an hour instead of the usual $50 for the entire day that you paid so far. So this can ruin your entire day for sure. Uh so the thing is Annibbook's office is uh right next to uh Oracle Park where the San Francisco Giants play and on game days especially those taking place in the morning or afternoon uh parking rates spike from $50 a day to 40 plus dollar per hour. Our team was constantly uh getting caught off guard showing up to expensive parking or scrambling to find remote cheaper alternatives. We needed a way to know in advance when to take public uh public transit instead of driving to work. And so the solution was I was thinking okay I think let's share a calendar like a joint calendar that just show you on which days uh parking lot prices are likely to to to surge. I needed two things for that. I needed to figure out when games are taking place in the ballpark and I needed to create a calendar file. I had no idea how to do calendar file is a ICS file. This is the type. I have no idea how to how to create one. >> Okay, whatever. Uh, let's go to chat GPT. >> So, while you're getting this up, I am just smiling and laughing because my Launch Sharkly office was right behind Oracle Park and I got very I found a $20 a day parking and I still have like I texted my friend the day I had to pay like $100. >> Yeah. to park. I was already down there ready for a meeting. And so San Francisco downtown is we're coming back people. But don't forget that the summer the summer baseball season and sometimes they have two games a day. They have double headers. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] >> That is correct. And then you have Yeah. Walk over there. Just don't use your car. >> Just don't go. Just don't go. [laughter] Don't go. >> If you can avoid it, avoid it. Um yeah. So I was like let's try chat GPT. I mean this should be a simple one hopefully. So I tried naive one. Okay as you can see this prompt doesn't tell the chat you are this or that. I was like I have a simple question. Find uh all home games that take place in a rockol park in San Francisco during the next six months. I use six month because I knew it's uh the end of the season coming soon. So you can ask for the next year. or whatever. Filter out only the games that start anywhere between morning to 2:00 p.m. because if uh games are taking place in the evening, when we arrive in the morning, the the prices are still the usual sane one. Uh so using these dates, create an IC file for Google calendar. That's the calendar that we're using at work. Uh that will show these dates as an all day event. I wanted I wanted just to see very clearly uh potential dates days in my week where I rather avoid driving uh to the office. And a key point was availability free otherwise this all day event will just uh block my entire day show me as busy just because the Giants are playing. Uh, also the event description should contain the game details and time. I wanted to add that so I can verify that the game is uh is the one that I thinking about that it's actually one that is taking place there. I I like to add those extra verification point validation point just to make sure that that uh we know what we're talking about. Um, and then I also added an instruction other than just um output the ICS file that I need the calendar file. I want a textual list of all the dates, times, and events included in the created calendar. Now, basically, if it was human, they may have been a little, you know, offended by me. Why don't you trust me? But but creativity doesn't care. So it it thought for 36 seconds, provided me with a file and also with a list of all the remaining games because the season is about to end. All the remaining games that are taking place in Oracle Park with their uh dates and times. And so I know all of these are included in this file. I just took the file, I um installed it or added it to my personal calendar or work calendar. I also shared it with all of my uh team members. And then you upload it and then you can see for example that on September 10th there's [snorts] a game uh Arizona Diamondbacks are are playing uh the Giants at first beach is uh 12:45. So better avoid driving to work that day. I I love this so much um because again I have hit this problem so many times and you don't want a calendar that has the game in the middle of your work day, right? You want to custom you probably could have filed like an SF Giant schedule calendar. That's not exactly what you wanted and it would have had all these games, weekend games, night games, all these things that were away games. >> Exactly. So you can have this really filtered to what you want. I'm going to give you one one improvement that you can make to this. >> Yeah. >> Which is for the night games, you should put an alert because if you park in the morning and you're still there for the night game, you should just go to the game. It's a great It's a great stadium. >> That's an excellent suggestion. >> Fun to watch the games. Good view. Um it's finally warm in San Francisco, so it won't be freezing. >> Yeah. And you parked cheap. >> And you parked cheap. I've done that once or twice where I parked. I'm like, I'm not leaving honestly because I don't want to deal with the traffic. I'm just going to go go to the game. This is a great little workflow. I think like a very good little helper personal workflow that helped you and also your team. So, thanks for showing. So, just >> again to recap your use cases. First one we did, oh, agents for recruiting. Loved it. So straightforward. I'm going to use that right away. >> Two, generated persona GBTs. and three, make your daily life a little bit easier by giving you ambient information that can help with your commute. So, we're going to wrap our episode with a couple lightning round questions and then get you out of here. The first one I have to say is you are the little helper. You seem to be all over Honeybook just helping recruiting, helping the product team, helping the whole team, you know. Tell us a little bit about your role and what you think this role will look like. Do people need a dedicated person or a dedicated team >> towards these automations? What do you think the future of this inside companies is going to look like? >> Okay, for sure. Well, I I love nothing more than talking about myself. So, [laughter] my title is uh technical operations engineer. Uh but it encapsulate a lot of other things. So I do uh I research and integrate paid tools but a lot of the times you don't find the exact paid tool that you want. So I build them. I build internal tools and processes. I'm using no code solutions, automations and also coded solutions. It can be an AI powered Slackbot. Uh it can be an internal application. It could be integrations between um two different applications that don't speak with one another. So I come in the middle and I connect them. Um it's not just doing things for others. Uh it's also teaching and enabling others to do for themselves. Uh I'm a great believer in enabling. Uh so I do companywide presentations. I do personal advisory training classes, documentation actually um as Anibbook is a is a platform for uh small businesses. Okay. Um I see each team and department within Anibbook as a small business of its own. They provide services. They collaborate with other teams, other businesses. Uh they have their own goals. They have their own expertise, passion for different things and they all want to spend less time on manual, thoughtless, repetitive tasks and more time doing what they love. So this is where I'm coming for. This is what I'm trying to do. This is what I'm trying to provide to take the to take the the the friction away and leave you to do what you love. One thing I want to call out for folks is I've been in tech a long time and unfortunately basically up until the last couple years I feel like internal tools teams were very starved for resources and occasionally starve for respect. It was like oh you got the product teams and they're customerf facing and they build all the cool product and like internal teams are always underfunded not enough people blah blah blah blah blah. And I think now what I love is this is the moment for internal tools teams to shine to do legitimate great high impact product work. I would recommend anybody who really wants to lean into AI find their way into this kind of role because honestly a lot of times it's moving faster than you can even get some of these AI experiences into product which have a lot of like customer impact and legal implications and blah blah blah blah. if it's if it's all internal tooling, you can kind of let it rip. And so, I just want to like shout out to all the internal tools teams out there that I know to date have not got the love and respect that they deserve. This is your moment. Um, you can have really high impact and do some pretty great work and honestly do a lot to differentiate your career in in this moment by taking advantage of the fact that you can build these tools. So, I think you are a great model and I'm excited to see you do it. >> Yeah. >> Okay, last question. You're a very good prompter. In fact, you create prompters to create prompts. Um, but >> when AI is not replying to you the way you want, when it is frustrating, when the agent gets distracted by the notifications in its inbox, >> what is your prompting technique? Are you all caps? Do you yell? Do >> Wow. Well, I I love using all caps and no one can persuade me otherwise. I mean, there will be people saying it's just a robot. It doesn't care if it caps or not, but I'm like, no, it takes me a lot more seriously when it's all caps. Um but but I will say um my go-to technique would be to take my current prompt and then tackle the chat GPT with my prompt asking it to make it better and how do I do that? It's not just this is not working make it better. Even as a person I I would I have no idea what you want for me. Um, so I I'm just going with this is the prompt I'm using. This is this is what's wrong with the output. Like I outline the output is inconsistent. Uh contains too many hallucinations, invent things that are not there. That's the second part. And then I uh it's very important for me that the prompt will one two three four I I list the things that not just what what is wrong but what how I want it to be right and then I also add um I also added I give it permission take away everything that doesn't work well. Yeah, you can delete things from my prompt. You can rewrite things that don't work well and you can add things that you feel are will do a better job and I feel like given permission to change, delete, remove whatever uh provides a better output because otherwise and chubities tend to be pleasers. They may try to uh use your prompt and not move a lot out of it like this is yours. This is so great. I'm not going to change it. No, I allow you to change it. I allow you to rewrite it completely. And I tried it several times on several prompts, not just my own. People are coming with me with why does my custom J GPT act so badly? Um like let's let's take your prompt and rewrite it using Chad GPT. So I go with that template and and like first try it's amazing. first try, you get a a prompt that is much much much better. And usually it's it only takes that one iteration for it to work exactly as you wanted it to. Um, so that's my tip. >> I I love it. It's a very professional tip um that I will use in my moments where instead I just want to write no in all caps. Uh, which, you know, I try to pretend that I'm this very, you know, patient and sophisticated and AI friendly prompter, but I think the more comfortable I get with it, the more ridiculous my my [laughter] prompts get. So, it's a good reminder that structure can help. Well, this has been so fun. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful to you? >> Uh, you can find me in LinkedIn. Um I am linkedin.com/mikalluda mikall.pelad. Um and u I I work at honeybook. So you can just search for mik pelad honey and find me. I would really love to connect with anyone who is into automations, AI, um new things, whatever. I want to see what you do. I want to see what you're working on. and I get constant ideas from other people in LinkedIn, in Facebook, whatever. Um, I'm there and um, uh, from you um, you saw something that I did here and it's strike you with a great idea, uh, a way to improve it. um you want to suggest things that I can do better uh or even if you want more information for me, just feel free to reach out, ask questions. Um I'll be happy to answer. It's one of my favorite things to talk about my work. Um so feel free to do that. >> Well, you heard it. Drop drop drop questions in the comments. Connect on LinkedIn and if Honeybook is hiring, you now know how they search for great candidates. So if you're a great >> Yeah, we are hiring. Make sure your profile is [laughter] well well structured and well well made. >> You know, maybe maybe use the agent to say, I'm applying for this job. Could you find me on LinkedIn as a good match and what would I do to improve it? That's the last tip for how I AI. Professional AI girl right here. Well, it was so nice to have you.

    "transcript": "[music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claireo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have a really fun mini episode where I'm going to answer the question on everyone's mind. Which of these new models is actually the best designer? I'm going to take a page on my site that I don't think is particularly welldesigned and have Gemini [music] 3, Opus45, and Codeex 51 duke it out and see which one can redesign my page better. One shot. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Lovable. If you've ever had an idea for an app, but didn't know where to start, Lovable is [music] for you. Lovable lets you build working apps and websites by simply chatting with AI. [music] Then you can customize it, add automations, and deploy it to a live domain. It's perfect for marketers spinning up tools, product managers [music] prototyping new ideas, or founders launching their next business. Unlike no code tools, Lovable isn't about static [music] pages. It builds full apps with real functionality. And it's fast. What used to take weeks, months, or even years, [music] you can now do over the weekend. So, if you've been sitting on an idea, now's the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at lovable.dev. [music] That's lovable.dev. If you've been paying attention the last couple of weeks, it seems like every single model provider has released a brand new coding model. And what I heard the most from people is sure they're fast and sure they're great and sure they're beating benchmarks, but they are all really good at design. If you've been on X or social media, you've probably seen these beautifully designed landing pages, apps, and user experience components generated using Gemini 3 or Opus 45 or even Codeex 5.1. And I thought, let's put these side by side and actually see which one's better at redesigning an existing page. I think it's easy to oneshot something and make it look beautiful, especially if you're a great prompter and know exactly what to say as a designer, but if you have an existing site and you want to make it better, who's your trusted design engineer? Which of these models is really going to do the trick? And I'm going to show you what I think today in a couple minutes on which of these models is the better designer or redesigner of a page that I don't think is really great. So, this is the chat PRD blog. It is not very good. I don't think this is a very beautiful site. It's not my favorite. I think it could be a lot better. And it could be a lot better from a functional perspective, but it can also be a lot better from a design perspective. And you know, if I had a team, which I have a little small one, but if I had a team that was not AI, I might send this to designer and say, \"Hey, we just launched this um early on. It's not great. Can you redesign it?\" And so I wanted to test that flow with some of the new models that have come out that have said that they are better designers than previous versions. And so I fired up cursor and I did a model by model comparison of redesigns. And I used the exact same prompt, exact same input code, and we're just going to see which one we think is the better designer. So I'm going to show you my prompt here in cursor. It was pretty straightforward. It was this redesign the blog page. So I just showed it the directory of where our blog page is to improve both the visual appeal and user experience. So sort of both like will it look nicer and will it be functionally a little easier to use and then I added a functional component to it which was add best practices for SEO and navigation. And then I did that for three different models. I did it for Gemini 3 Pro. I did it for Opus45 for anthropic and I did it from GPT51 codecs. These are all recently released models that have been said to be their bestin-class models from OpenAI, from Anthropic, and from Google. And so we're going to see exactly what it did. And I started with Gemini 3 Pro. The reason why I started with Gemini 3 Pro is I've heard over and over and over again what a great designer Gemini 3 Pro is. And I really wanted to see what it did. And so you can see here it thought quite a bit um about visual design, user experience, SEO, navigation. It looked at the code and it start started executing. So it started writing some code and we're going to switch over and see exactly what it generated. So it generated this. This was the before if you recall. Very, very boring, not very good. And in the after, it generated a nice hero image of the most recent blog post. So, there's now this like highlighted blog post at the top and then these cards at the bottom. And a couple improvements I see here. There's some tagging here. There's some date of releases. There's this nice hover effect that zooms in on our featured images when you zoom in. Haven't done anything regarding pageionation, which is a current functionality that doesn't really take into account whether or not we have featured images and making that look good. So, there's some things there that could be improved, but I think overall it's pretty good. One thing that I noticed that it did that I did not love is that there's this tag at the very top of the page, and it's just a little too tight with the rest of the navigation. So, one of my reflections here is, you know, it doesn't have like the full visual context of the page, but it did a pretty nice job and it was very fast. But I have to say, despite Gemini 3's reputation for being the best designer, it was actually not my favorite. So we I ran the exact same query in cursor with Opus 45. So if you look up here, redesigned the blog to improve both the visual appeal and UX and add best practices for SEO and navigation. Now, the difference that I thought was really interesting when using Gemini 3 versus Opus 45 is Opus45 actually triggered um a to-do list inside cursor. So, it did a tool call to to create a to-do list and it gave a stepbystep flow it was going to follow. So, Gemini 3 sort of did that chain of thought um reasoning and then just you'll load code. Opus 45 created four to-dos. So the to-dos were redesign the blog listing page, improve the blog layout, enhance the post display and add comprehensive SEO structure data, canonical URLs and metatags. And so it was very precise step by step on what it was going to do in terms of implementing. And so I think the planning capabilities of Opus 45 are certainly better. I think Anthropic has really different differentiated themselves as experts in coding models. You know, if I wanted to get the best outcome here, I probably should have done this in Claude code because I think there's some optimizations they've done there recently as well. But I thought it was really interesting that the output of a planned implementation was much better than the output of a straight shot oneshot implementation. And so you can see it went step by step and actually checked off those changes and then provided me a a summary of changes. And I'm going to switch and show you exactly what that looked like cuz I was actually impressed by by the design. So, this is what we got from Opus45, which I think, spoiler alert, from all the models was the most beautifully designed blog page that I got and also honestly the most functional from an SEO perspective. And so, what you can see that Opus45 did here is it pulled some images. We have a repository of beautiful background images and featured images that we use throughout the chat pd website. It actually pulled and looked for assets that it could bring in that would look nice. These rings are some um design elements that we use commonly. And so it pulled in some interesting assets. If you recall, Gemini 3 just had a gradient background. Opus 45 actually added some imagery in the background. very similar concept in terms of the layout. So you see again a featured article that is the most recent blog post. Again, three column cards with the zoomin trick. So I guess people like it. But if you look at this, a couple nice design tweaks that Opus45 added. When you hover, not only does the image zoom in, but it gives you this nice little call to action here, this little arrow. I think it is so cute. Just does that nice little touch hover treatment on the um anchor link for the blog post. Again, tags are in. And then it did a little bit more on the SEO side. And I will wrap back around to the SEO changes that each of them made. But if you see here, not only do you have the author, which is me, Clarvo, you have the date, which we also saw in the Gemini 3 option, but it also has an estimated time reading and a link. And so I just think the quality of the design here went probably 20 or 30% further than the Gemini 3 model went. And it's those nice edge touches that I feel like AI can add into any design that just makes it so much nicer to work with. And I was really impressed with Opus 45 in terms of the quality of the detail orientation. Now let's go down. You know, one of the things that it did is it handled no images a little smarter than Gemini 3 did. So, if you recall, Gemini 3 kind of collapsed these cards here, did not put placeholder images in. Here with Opus45, it saw that we were missing images for some of our blog posts and put a little placeholder with a nice little book icon here, which I think is lovely. It makes these cards just look a lot nicer and is really welld designigned. So overall, I think that Opus45 did an excellent job out of the box of redesigning a page and not only redesigning the page, but really thinking about the functional components of it. And I think a lot of that goes to its planning mode and its ability to call tools and then do some of these implementations step by step. Now, let's get to the last model that I tested, which was codeex 51 Pro. So, again, same prompt here. Redesign the blog to improve the visual appeal and UX and add best practices from SEO. Edit GPT51 codecs, um, the leading coding model from Open AI. Again, codec codecs like Opus 45 thought and generated to-dos. The to-dos were a little less granular than the one from Opus. So, if you look at Opus, the to-dos were redesign the blog listing page with specifics about how I was going to redesign, improve the blog layout, enhance a specific component, and then add SEO. The plans for 51 codecs were a little bit more general. They were investigate current layout, redesign, apply SEO. So I think the planning was just not as thoughtful from a design perspective as the planning was from Opus 45. And then if we actually look at the design, oh, OpenAI, you know, I love you. Some of my favorite models, but it did not do well on this redesign. And so you can see a couple things that it didn't do well right out the gate. one, it gave me AI slop purple gradient. Like, we do not need any more purple to blue gradients in a AI designs. We need to get them out of here. And so, just the fact that we got AI purple is an immediate disappointment. The other thing, and this may be a me problem, but I think we have a white um word mark and a better logo to use here. And you can tell here just the image it selected is not nice on top of a colored background. Now I do think that the headline and copy from the um from the blog is really nice stories, playbooks and experiments from the team. Um so it gives a little bit more context. So this was the model that did the best copywriting perhaps but overall the design was not very good. And then again it did a featured post here. This is the image from our most recent blog post, but there's no context. There's no call to action. It doesn't link to anywhere. And so, I'm just really unsure what it was expecting users to experience. Now, it's repeated here. Um, the featured blog. So, again, I think these I think these models really like I guess there aren't that many fancy things in blog design and that you all have to have a featured image and then a three row um layout for your blog post. So, it did do the featured image here, but the problem is it added a bunch of these links that don't really I don't understand how they work. They only do the featured image in each of these categories. The jumping's kind of weird. And then if you look at it at browse the library, it doesn't even show the blog posts that exist in our overall um library. And so it's both not pretty, it's purple, and it doesn't work. And so I was really surprised cuz I've had pretty good experience with um GPT5 and 51 in functional sort of backend work, but the front end work, it just really struggled. And I will tell you, this is not a complicated app. This is a basic, you know, blog layout with a basic CMS on the background. It is nothing that is technically complicated. And so what I would say from a GPT codeex 51 perspective is it's not going to be the designer on your team. It has another role to play on your team. And I have found plenty of places for this model to be really really useful. But design is not one of them. And so I would say just looking back Opus 45 absolutely my favorite from a front-end design perspective. Gemini 3 very serviceable could probably benefit from some planning and implementation and then codeex 5.1 is just not your front-end girl. So we got to get something else in the front end. And what I like about testing these models on a specific use case like this where it's repeated is you can start to understand which model goes at what part of your workflow. I'm a real believer in model switching. I know everybody has their personal preferences, but I think there are great models for writing. I think there are great models for design. I think there are great models for image genen. I think there's great models for planning and strategic thought. And I think there's great models for back-end coding. And not all of these models are created equal. They're all exceptional. I mean, think about the work that they can do on behalf of teams. But they're not all the same. And I think as you test them out, looking at similar use cases over models and making a decision about where you're going to place a model on a team is a really important skill to have as you're developing your AI fluency as a designer, as a product manager, and as an engineer. Now, I want to go through the functional side of things before we wrap up this little mini app, which is going to be a true mini app hopefully under 20 minutes, which is summarizing the changes you made. So, I asked each of the models to summarize the changes they made into in terms of design changes, SEO changes, and just what did it do? And so, you know, I like this as a workflow as you're working with coding agents, especially if you're if you're running a lot of them and you're not paying attention to them, asking it to summarize the changes it made so you can compare them are really useful. And so if you look at Gemini 3, it made a new hero section, which we know. It made feature post layout, which we know. Glassmorphism card. Thank you. Thank you, Apple, for giving us glassorphism. I think we could live without it, but it's at least a standard likable design style. So, it has scaling images, deepening shadows, improved typography, related articles, and visual breadcrumbs. Now, let's look at this because one of the things I did not check is if these models actually changed how the blog post themselves showed up. So, let's click into that and see if there were layout changes that were made to the actual blog posts. And there were. Okay. So, Gemini 3 did make some changes to the actual blog posts and it said it added related articles. Okay. So that's a little bonus is it went beyond just the the blog homepage and it added some SEO functionality into the blog post itself. Now let's read the rest of the changes from an SEO perspective. Good JSON LD great SEO schema that we definitely want breadcrumbs which we definitely want semantic HTML which is really helpful especially in blog and then related articles and metadata. So, lots of very helpful, I think, highquality SEO changes to my blog post from Gemini 3 Pro. So, I'm going to give it a little bit more credit in that it went a little further than I initially analyzed. Um, and actually went to the blog pages itself. But, let's check that against my favorite, which was Opus 45. So, I'm going to look at Opus 45. What changes did it make? Now, see, these changes are extensive. So again, I think that planning mode really allowed it to make very specific changes across a variety of components. So it made future post and three column card grid which we know the little arrow slide in that I noted, reading time badges, category pills, breadcrumbs which we like, and graceful empty state. So these are all things that I identified when I was visually scanning the design that I thought was really nice. Um the blog layout had this nice rings pattern improving spacing and then the post display um has more information. So let's actually see what it did on the posts if anything. So let's click through. So it made again very similar changes to what we saw in Gemini 3. So again like don't redesign uh everything. If you are doing something like a blog, you're going to get best practices. So, it brought in that metadata in terms of author, date, and reading time. Let's see if it added those anchor links. It did not add um any related links. So, it maybe didn't do as great of a job on the SEO on the individual article pages, but it did do a really nice job redesigning the call to action at the bottom of our blog post, which is something that I don't think Gemini did. So, it added I'm sorry to say it is again AI purple slop. So, we got to say no more purple. Especially chat purity is so pink. It should know it. It should see pink everywhere in my repo. It should do this. But other than the purple, I think this is a really nice call to action for a newsletter subscribe. There's a subtle gradient in here. There's a drop shadow. This little um kind of uh avatar call out next to how many product managers are subscribed. Actually, there's like 90,000 product managers subscribed, so we got to update the content there. I think this is a really nice little component. And this is another thing I've noticed about these new coding models is we're all getting wowed by these beautiful page designs and app designs. What is really impressive is you give it like a small little component, a little widget, and have it redesign, it looks so much nicer. So that's what it did from a design perspective. Let's see from an SEO perspective. So, metadata again, open graph, um, structured data. Let's see if it did JSON LD. It didn't specifically call out JSON LD. So, I'm going to have to check to see if it did that. That's one important part of our SEO road map at Chatard we've been working on. So, I was surprised not to see it. But again, maybe you put Opus 45 in the designer mode and you put some of these other models in your like SEO engineer mode and then another model in your sort of like backend engineering mode. So maybe we just have figured out where each of these models need to live. Now let's do our last one and look at codeex 51. What were the changes it made? Now this is the shortest uh shortest summary. And again, this is the one that did the worst job at this. I will say also GPT5 models love a bullet point. If you see a bullet point, this is a five or 51 response here. And so I asked it to categorize the changes you made. Again, use the exact same prompt. It gave me five bullet points. Very lazy. Um, so hero panel, category chips, featured article layout, and then SEO changes, did metadata, and embedded a schema.org. So they it did the JSON LD block. Um, so that's good. So again, we weren't really impressed with the codeex 5 GPT 51 codeex model on design and actually not that impressed on the details in terms of user experience and SEO. So I think maybe this this guy belongs in the back end. I probably could have prompted it better, but again, the point of this mini episode is to show if we have a basic prompt. The same way I would speak to a colleague that I don't have time to tell exactly how to make better, I'm hoping they can research and understand how to make a page better. I would just say, \"Hey, our blog is not good. We need to prove the SEO. We need to prove the UX and it needs to be prettier. Can you just take care of it?\" um what it would do. And that's how I like to think about these models is how do they respond to these natural requests you would make in the day-to-day of your work and then compare how they do on the outset. So to recap for everyone, we did a we started with a existing layout. It was not pretty. It was not functional. It was not good. We gave a threeline prompt to redesign it for UX, visual appeal, and SEO. And then we compared three models. We compared Google's Gemini 3, Anthropics, Opus 45, and Open AI's GPD 5.1 codecs. And the winner was for sure on the design side Anthropic's Opus45 model both from a design perspective as well as a usability and SEO perspective and it went further than even my prompt requested. The hypothesis here is both it is better trained on high-quality front-end design as well as its detailed planning allows it to do a much better job on the details and implementation than these other models that do more shallow planning or no planning at all as we saw in the Gemini 3 case and so we just got a better outcome. I love my new blog design. I am very excited about this. If we just take a step back, it is incredible that in less than 20 minutes, we were able to generate not one, not two, but three alternative designs for an existing website. We were able to get massive upgrades on the functionality of it, especially some technical SEO stuff, and I was able to pick the one I like. Imagine asking your teammate to design you three different options, give you three different plans for SEO, and then tell you which, you know, have to go back and forth on which one you like better. I think this is an awesome flow. I loved it so much. I'm actually just going to go ahead and ship this today. So, we'll put it in the show notes so you can see exactly what happened. And that is my takedown of which of the new models from November 2025 is the best designer. And I think the winner is Opus45. Thank you so much for joining this mini episode of How I AI.

    "transcript": "When all these tools we use every day started coming up, I started figuring out how can I be an AI enhanced PM? So, how can I be better at my job, have more impact, be more productive? So, what you're going to walk us through is this has inspired some ideas of wow, if I had a fridge and a video and data. What products could I build that would be useful to me as a consumer? Where would you start as a PM who is working on a smart fridge? Within minutes, I can literally see what the entirety of the world is thinking about. We have opinions in our hands and we can split and filter out these opinions based on people that want this versus people that don't want this. And we can actually read and have them debate with each other so that we know what it would take to find product market fit. Okay, you did your market research in 3 minutes and your PR generation in 90 seconds. Now, my job is not done as a PM. The next step is to actually create a prototype so that the people that I will present this idea to will see my vision having flesh. Welcome back to how I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have Marilyn Nika, a AI product lead at Google and AI educator who's thinking a lot about how AI is changing the art of product management. She's going to speedrun us through using some of her favorite tools to do market research, build out requirements documents, prototype complicated things, and a few tricks on how to use AI Video Gen to influence your stakeholders and sell your vision. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets automatically. But there's a catch. These tools only work well when they have deep access to company systems. Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that raises serious security concerns. That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, access controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise features. Building all that from scratch, it's a massive lift. That's where Work OS comes in. Work OS gives you drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale up market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Cursor are already using work OS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at works.com. Start building today. Well, welcome to how I AI. I am excited because we have a very fun kind of unique product use case you've been thinking about and using AI to explore the space of what it means to both be an AIPM and how you can PM AI products. So let's dive in and talk to us about what's been on your mind in terms of products. >> Yeah, sounds good and thank you so much for for having me. Um yeah what I like to say is that I was in AI before it was cool and I was a pure AI PM meaning I was working with scientists and training models for speech recognition and it was great but since 2017 when all these you know tools we use every day started coming up I started figuring out you know how can I be an AI enhanced PM so how can I be better at my job have more impact be more productive and I'd be happy to walk you through a couple of my you know, how I how I AI. So, I'm just so excited to to be here. >> Great. And so, what fun product are we going to talk about as an example? I know that you have um lot, you know, we were just talking before the show, you have lots of jobs. I think this is a little bit of a hypothetical that we're going to work through, but I think it does show off some of the techniques that you've learned in the course of of the last couple years in your career. So, what are we talking about here? >> All right. So, when I was trying to come up with a cool use case when, you know, I was planning the the podcast, I thought about what happened last Sunday. And last Sunday, I was literally walking out from my house um with my kids and I look at the fridge and I post the that image that the fridge had on LinkedIn and as you can see that image went viral. So, it said these items are expiring soon. And it says my Coca-Cola apparently was 80 days old. First of all, I didn't know Coca-Cola expires. Second of all, I did not know my I did not know my fridge could do that. Okay, I know there is a inwards um facing camera, but I saw this and again I put my PM hat on. What an interesting insight. And as you can see, it says, you know, you can dismiss it, you can snooze. It does say search for recipes, you know, which is not great. But when I posted this, there were 700 likes, 100 comments of PMs commenting what they could do by having this information and 13 reposts. So, I'd love to unpack this as a use case and see how we can leverage this suite of amazing AI tools we have and just uh, you know, see see in action what it'd be like to be a PM for a smart fridge. This is totally product thinking because you have a device or something in your house and you get surprised by a user experience and I too did not realize Coca-Cola expired. I thought you could use it till the end of time. Um, and so what you're going to walk us through is this has inspired some ideas of wow, if I had a fridge and a video and data, what products could I build that would be useful to me as a consumer? and you're going to use that as an example to walk us through some of the really useful uh AI powered PM techniques you found over the past couple months. So, where would you start as a PM who is working on a smart fridge uh for busy families who who clearly have 80day old items in their fridge? Well, I we have this magic in our hands and the very first thing we do as PNS, right, is talk to users and listen to what users want and user research. Now, traditionally, you know, you would either leverage the UXR department of your company or you would hire an external research agency. But with AI, within minutes, I can literally see what the entirety of the world is thinking about. So I open up perplexity and something that not a lot of people know about is that there is this magic filter here. You can obviously search the web if you want or academic papers or you know SEC filings on finance but you can only search through discussions and opinions. So this searches through Reddit. So here's what I'm going to do. Okay. Um, would families be interested in a smart fridge? So, if I ask something like this, it's like I get the entirety of Reddit and people's opinions just mind at once and I can see references. I can see all the threads and I can jump into them to actually see the discussion and I see, you know, use cases that are kind of positive, family use cases, common concerns, adoption barriers, um, you know, some sentiment and all these things. Now, this alone is pure gold and the treasure. However, what I love doing is taking things one step further. So, here, bear with me. Here's what I'm going to do now. Create two items. one that is pro smart fridge and one that is against smart fridge. Use everything you read and have these two agents debate at least I don't know like 20 times about it and give me the minimum set of features I would need in order to convince the against agent. Now we're diving into Reddit. We're we have opinions in our hands and we can split and filter out these opinions based on people that want this versus people that don't want this. And we can actually read and have them debate with each other so that we know what it would take to find product market fit. And we're we did that in seconds. And it's just such an incredible incredible tool to have. All right. So here we have the pro- aagents arguments and then we have the against agents arguments and you can see the discussion is based on actual references from um from the actual discussion and then there's a 20 round debate of pros and cons and all these things and the best part is the ending where perplexity told me okay here's what you need to do in order to build a fridge um that is going to resonate with family which is your your target group. I can't even begin to describe how much time this has saved and how much more likely I am to find product market fit by leveraging uh this technology. So now naturally the next step um there's something I I do call tool hopping. So we're going to hop on to our next tool, but I'd love to see if there are any comments or any questions here. One comment I do have on this is so often we hear about AI that it really wants to tell you your ideas are great. And so I think if you just said, \"Do families want a smart fridge?\" without any additional prompting, it would probably bias towards telling you that families do want a smart fridge, maybe with some caveats, but it tends to be uh pretty agreeable when it comes to um uh interacting on ideas. And so I love this idea that I want to make sure people don't miss, which is actually prompting the AI to create two different personas in its analysis. Create a persona that's very for your idea or implementation or design or code. Create an agent that's very against your idea. Again, it doesn't have to be an idea. It could be, are you against the implementation of this code? Again, a really good use case. have them do a hypothetical or artificial debate on the topic and then deconstruct that debate in a way that allows you to identify what would be the convincing arguments, capabilities or implementation that might work. And so I think this is just a really great um little hack on getting higher quality um more critical thinking out of these LLMs that might be biased a little bit to agree with your ideas and tell you they're good. Yeah, I completely agree. And the most important part is I told it what format I need this response in. And the format I need it in is features cuz I'm a PM and because features is the input I need for the next tool I will demo. So now what I'm going to do is I am going to copy the the minimum set of features that perplex the things I need and then I'm going to go to trajub in order to create um a pd. Now I have created an AI product GBD as I like to call it that has a template of my favorite PD and essentially I prompt it with specific features and it outputs a PD in the style that I spit in my own voice. So the next step is I come here when it says ask anything and I say generate a PD about a smart fridge that has these features and essentially I am pasting the output for from Plexity and now there we go immediately it just generates and say okay well the PD is an AI enhanced smart bridge with local first intelligence this is what it includes here's the problem statement what users you know why privacy conscious consumers DIY open source enthusiasts summary and feature analysis of architecture key features of course it's does prioritization and all these good things at the same time now this is not going to be perfect immediately however it gives me an incredible head start in order to just have my strategic thinking in the in my and spend spend way less time in making a copy of the peer engine title. So now I'm an AI enhanced um PM. The other thing I want to call out for uh folks that are looking at this is this is a GPT specifically to create PRDS around AI powered products. Um I noticed or at least that's what it looks like. And so I do think that um you can create sort of general purpose document generators, but the more you can do a combination of structure and content in terms of your prompting, I think the higher quality results you're going to get. And so, okay, you did your market research in 3 minutes and your PR generation in 90 seconds, but you know, it's a long way to the factory floor and actually building this thing. And so, you know, once you have this, how do you like to think about designing great products with with AI or what's the next step for you? >> Yes, it's really interesting how this flow has changed, right? It used to be, hey, I'm a PM. I come up with an idea. I'd create a PR. I debate with a PRD and collaborate with my scientists and my engineers until we're done. And then we create a little MVP. Now my job is not done as a PM. Now that I have my PRD, the next step is I need to build. So I'm putting my AI builder hat, as I like to say it. And the next step is to actually create a prototype so that the people that I will present this idea to will see my vision having flesh. So the next step is to build to prototype. There is obviously many tools um that we can use. One of my favorite tools is of course um Vzero Lovable. Google AI studio has prototyping as well. Now um I will use Vzero. It's one of the tools that I have had you know the best kind of outputs with and what I did is I copied the output from my custom GVT and then I'm about to paste it here. So the prompt I will use here will be create the UI of a smart fridge given this PD as an input and I will just paste the whole thing because it's a very long document it takes it in as a note and then I just do this and then we just wait and do you feel like these PRDs obviously I do um you know we have an integration with with Vzero and all these vibe coding tools because we really believe that a PRD is a higher quality input to this. You know, have you tried this, you know, prompting directly versus just pasting in the PRD and feel like that extra step really does help with the prototyping quality? I do a lot of experimentation and I experimented because I wanted to move fast at some point and I realized that the number of tweaks I had to do later on really got me overwhelmed and tired versus me starting spending some more time in order to make sure the input is very very good. Um it really pays off. >> Yep. And you know, how do you think about where this might fit in the product development workflow? It seems like for you a prototype is really a communication tool. So it's a tool by which you know if somebody read the PRD you're like yeah it's a like locally intelligent smart fridge. Sure, whatever. But once you can see, touch, feel it, it becomes much more compelling. And so you know I'm curious. Do you think this is a influence tactic that PMs are are underestimating? Is it really to design the right thing? Where do you think PMs can use this kind of prototype? The perfect place to use this is at the product review. So, I find that a lot of product reviews happen more often now with AI because things move fast because some people are really not convinced with AI yet. So, if you enter a product review that's just about, hey, here's what I want to do. >> Are you in or are you out? Here's where you need to invest your resources in. And they can get a link and on their laptop actually touch it, feel it, see it, move around. You communicate your vision and your passion more effectively versus here's a PR that I turned into a deck for you so that I can walk you through it. It's just so much more. It adds credibility. It adds value. It's just so so so much more effective. >> Amazing. Okay. And now we have an open fridge dashboard. I have to call out for people who are not watching on YouTube and are listening. My favorite part of this UI is the door status widget that tells you if the door is open or closed. It's amazing. My kids go to the freezer to get ice cream and they don't close it. Mine too. Mine too. It beeps. If you >> No, you and I have the same life. They they close it like but it's this much this much open. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And the light is on and they're in such a rush to eat the ice cream that they don't care. Um okay. So yeah, we can see here fridge temperatures, door status, um power usage. That's a good one. You know the temperature that you can change recent activity. Oh, what time it opened and it closed. That's also good to call them out and say, \"Did you have an ice cream?\" um temperature check completed safety monitoring it's all these controls and you can see that this tool took the purity as an input and it added features on top of it. It guessed what the UI needs to look like. Um so imagine your leadership or even your cross functional partners to be able to experience your product idea. Imagine just how much more effective the meeting would be. Yeah. One thing I have to have to call out is because you said that privacy and local intelligence was so important in your PR based on your research. And I think that's a lot of people saying, \"I don't want my smart fridge monitoring me. I don't want a cloud connected smart fridge. I don't want advertising. I don't want monitoring.\" If you go up to I think hardware, I'm pretty sure or diagnostics. I'm pretty sure your smart fridge is shipping with a GPU, which I find very very funny. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> You know, maybe you can also run your coding models locally through through your fridge, you know. Exactly. I love it. It's a little bit of storage as well. Yeah, this is this is great. Um, but again, this is a wonderful 100% local processing. Look at this. It has a little band that shows you so that you can feel safe. Yeah, this is great. I would buy this. I think this is this really phenomenal. >> This is very much like a Silicon Valley fridge right here. It's in dark mode. It's uh it's got system diagnostics. As long as you can like rooe into your your fridge, people are going to be really happy. You've seen the doom and gloom headlines. AI is coming for your job. But the reality is a little bit brighter. In Miro's latest survey, 76% of people say AI can boost their work. It's just that 54% still don't know when to use it. As a product leader and a solo founder, I live or die by how fast I can turn fuzzy ideas into crisp value propositions, road maps, and launch plans. That's why I love Miro's innovation workspace. It drops an AI co-pilot inside the canvas so stickies, screenshots, and brainstorm bullets can become usable diagrams, product briefs, and even prototypes in minutes. Your team can dive in, riff, and iterate. And because the board feels like a digital playground, everyone has fun while you cut cycle time by a third. Miro lets humans and AI play to their strengths so that great ideas ship faster and happier. Help your teams get great done with Miro. Check out miro.com to find out how. That's mirror o.com. So, we have this and it's great. It's an amazing first activation. Obviously, for a real thing, um I would ask at least five to 10 follow-ups. Usually, I add some images of it as well. Maybe I add an animation and at that point things are great. But this is not enough. Um I add one more step to my workflow which is people really want to experience what this would look like from the user perspective. And nowadays we have all these wonderful tools that go from text to video. And so the next step I would like to do is actually go to flow. Flow is this um app by Google labs. And then if you click on create with flow, you can type new project. And then here you can literally just go back to perplexity if you want or get your P and say create a promotional clip for two for a couple using a smart fridge that has these features. And I can paste. And then you can choose what um model you want to have. So for example, what you know the aspect ratio is, whether it's going to be fast, if it's going to have audio. I think I'm going to go with high quality just to see what can come out of it. And then hit this. And then we with movie magic, we can make people wait a little less uh as this generates. But I love Veo. It's such a great model. >> Such an amazing model. I've been using Sora too at the same time. I have the the app on my phone and >> obviously you know that generates in seconds which is amazing and you can do cameos and all that stuff but >> they they roll it out as part of a social network. I don't know if you've tried it now. >> It's interesting. It's creepy at the same time but mostly interesting. But yeah, I had >> I had my AirPods and I took a photo of it and I told Sora I said, \"Hey, tag Merrily using these and make that an advert and it zooms in and it opens it up on the sky and has me saying a nice girl.\" Amazing times. Amazing times. Absolutely. Yeah. My my kids find it very funny when I make um Sora cameos of myself being like a like doing kung fu fighting or doing something really funny. So it's quite it's quite entertaining. I'm you know I think the the social network aspect of it is a distribution um method for the underlying API models. So, I think it just shows sort of power users what's possible with it and probably then people get excited about commercial applications. But I think it's pretty pretty cool. Look at this door. A jar. They're really worried about that door being open. >> Also, the screen is inside the refrigerator in one of the >> What is going on? Okay. Um, yeah, let's play. I hope the video I hope the audio is going to go through. Okay, let's see. Number one, >> get instant local notifications like when the door is a jar, ensuring your food stays fresh and secure. Get instant. >> So number one, again for people who are not on YouTube and enjoying this high quality AI generated video, there is a screen on the refrigerator. This very attractive, well-dressed couple opens up the refrigerator and there's another screen inside. >> Amazing. All right, number two. Let's see. >> Okay, >> two screens again. That's uh interesting. That's interesting. Um there's no voice. >> Cool music on this one. Yeah, cool music. This one, there is a screen inside. Basically, the only thing you can see inside the refrigerator is a screen that says the doors open and then when you close the door, the screen shows up again. Let's keep fingers crossed for number three being the winner. >> All right, let's see. >> It says we have enough for the lasagna recipe right here. >> Perfect. And I love that it's all stored locally. No cloud needed. It says we have >> I think we have a wiener player. >> I I think so. Except if you watch it again, I think the man has disappeared >> and it's replaced by a lady. Watch. Watch this. >> We have enough for the lasagna recipe right here. >> Perfect. And I love that it's all stored locally. No cloud needed. It >> did. It's >> Well, we don't need them anymore. We're good. >> You know what? But it is kitchen setting. That's interesting. Um, you know what I may do? I may actually generate myself um >> a Sora >> opening and Sora. I think that would be a very interesting >> I think we should do Okay, so we're going to contrast and compare. How would I improve this? I think you know my feedback on prompting here is it's really overindexed on this door is open use case. So, I would probably pull that from the prompt. And I would also maybe as a good product manager, one of my favorite parts to put in a in a PRD, this is in our default chat pd is actually what's called a narrative, which is a story about an end user getting value from the product or being successful with the product. And I like to write those stories as part of PRDS because I think it it forces you to take a very user centric lens on a list of features. And so I might generate a narrative here and try the like pick a pick a hero story from the narrative as opposed to overindexing so much on the features. Um but the quality is amazing. >> The quality is amazing and this took what 30 minutes. If we didn't comment and laugh it would have been like a 20 minute workflow. So, it's just >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Exactly. >> Okay. So, what we're doing now, just for folks that um again are just listening and not on video, we are pulling up Sora. You have created a cameo of yourself, which is basically like an AI avatar of your face. Um warning to people who are using Soras to create cameos. They really force you to continue to dress how you're dressed in your cameo. So, I was wearing like very printed shirt when I did my Cameo, first cameo recording, and now all my clothes in every Cameo are crazy. Um, but you're generating OpenAI Sora video. Did you use the exact same prompt or did you change it a little bit? very similar prompt, but I decided to add someone else in my cameo and I looked at who enables who can do that and I'm adding Mark Cubain to our deal. >> I think we're going to get I think we're going to get a cost plus drugs advertisement because also I don't know if you know this uh folks that are listening about Sora when you create your cameo you can ship it with custom instructions. So you can say never generate this or always generate that. I say always make me look good on my cameo. And I'm pretty sure Mark Cuban put in his like in every video make sure to put a cost plus drugs ad in it. So I think we're going to get a smart smart fridge video with a embedded advertisement >> for Mark company. You know, I had added um make me have a pet pegasus with me at all times. Everything I do, there's like a pet of Pegasus with me. Um but yeah, let's see. Let's see how it goes. Um all right, my cameo is ready. First time I'm watching it. It's me and Mark Kuban opening a smart fridge. Um all right, let's see. Let's see how it goes. I don't know what we're going we're about to see. So, this is the smart fridge you told me about. >> Yeah. Watch what happens when I wake it up. >> It looks like a normal fridge >> until it starts thinking. Oh, it already knows what's inside. >> Mediterranean quinoa bowl, Greek salad, pasta primma vera. >> I mean, first of all, Greek salad. That was interesting. I'm Greek. I think it's >> I know. It must have known. >> But I mean, pretty impressive, right? It came out with a little dialogue and it's added two people. I mean, this is magic. Look, PMS, what I want you, we've we've had some giggles here, but let's just take a step back and talk about what we've done in basically 20 minutes. We have done full endtoend user research using the wealth of information available in Reddit. We've come up with a highly defensible set of features which we turned into a PRD. We turn that PRD into a prototype that then you could take into a product review and click through. And then just, you know, we're going to work on our prompting a little bit and our cameos, but just imagine pairing that with some sort of videogenerated visual or set of visuals that really just hammer home the value proposition of the thing that you're trying to build. And that package, which we just talked about, we just did, can actually be built in like 15 to 20 minutes without the chitchat. And it's just something that is was never ever ever possible before. And so what I think you're showing is the way we do product has changed. The way we convince and influence our internal stakeholders has changed. The way we communicate both product value and functionality has changed. If you use a combination of these tools, even if you hit some silly roadblocks, you've just like totally flipped product management and the process on its head and made it just much more compelling. >> It's just incredible how the role has changed of being a PM. You got to be AI enhanced. And it's not like AI is taking over a role. If anything, PMs that use AI are the ones that are going to take over the role of people that don't use AI. So, it's just so important to explore and adapt and see which tools fit to your workflow because, you know, my choices might not be the same as other people's choices, right? Um, but I'm excited I get to to share them with you. >> Great. So, in addition to this um kind of new world AIPM stuff, you have one other kind of power use case of another tool that we we've seen occasionally on the show, but not too frequently, and I think your use case is really interesting. So, do you want to spin that up? >> Yeah, sounds good. So outside of my day job as an AI PM, I'm an AI educator and a founder of the AI product academy and I have a boot camp. It's AI product management boot camp and certification and people get to join us for six weeks and build their own product end to end. They actually launch a product by having an an engineer attached to them. Now we have a demo day and that's the best part of the boot camp. Everyone comes in, presents, they earn prizes, they pitch to VCs, and I wanted to add AI as a judge. And I thought about how I could do that long and hard. And I ended up using Notebook LM as a judge. And I want to show you what this looks like cuz it was super cool. It's super interesting. So on June 13, we had a demo day. And what I did is I recorded the audio of every single pitch and I uploaded these separate files here. So this notebook actually has all these presentations. And then I went to the audio overview and I added specific instructions to focus on for these AI hosts. And I said, \"Okay, this is the demo day of Marily's AI product management boot camp, and I want you to select the top three apps based on these criteria. Number one, you know, how innovative it was. Number two, impact. And number three, storytelling.\" and I want you to announce these three winners. And then I click generate. And it's phenomenal. Now it's actually generating the audio overview. And you can imagine my boot camp at the end. It's like 200 people really waiting to see what AI is going to say. And we actually did a test with uh well we have live judges and then real people and then the AI and AI really chooses the best demos indeed. So it does listen to all um the audio and it's just such an amazing use case. Everyone loves it. >> I love this so much and it just opens my mind to a couple other use cases that um I've seen very commonly. So demo days both for courses and for hack days or hack weeks could be really useful. I have been in so many sales enablement or sales kickoff meetings where AES do pitch competitions and what a fun way to add sort of like a thirdparty analysis to pitch competitions and make those kind of fun. And so what I love about Notebook LM is you can do audio and multiple file in and then audio and multiple file out. And I think that's really really fun. It's great. And now you can actually do video overviews as well. I haven't tried that for my boot camp, but that could be interesting as well. All right. So now there is a file that got generated on the right. We can either play and hear the whole podcast presenting all the ideas and walking us through them or we can do this super cool thing where you can have this kind of interactive mode which is like an actual live radio podcast where you call in. So, let's do that because I really like this. >> Welcome back to the deep dive. Okay, so you sent over this uh Oh, our listeners got something to share. Let's hear it. >> Hello. We're actually in a rush. Can you please announce the three-way mayors right now? >> Oh, absolutely. We hear you. >> We could definitely cut to the chase, but we do want to give just a little context for >> That's fair. We were just setting up the criteria for judging these fantastic projects. >> And we are totally ready to announce the three winners. >> The quality was so high across the board. >> These projects are tackling some huge problems like health, anxiety, and life administration. >> We grouped the pain points into three big areas. health and wellness pain, >> the grind which is time and life admin pain. >> And the third one is the knowledge and empowerment gap. >> Things like struggling with learning or bad leadership. >> We judge them on three things in Hey, yeah, what's up? >> Just tell me the winners. You're taking too long. >> Oh, we completely understand the need for speed. We got ahead of ourselves. >> You are absolutely right. We apologize for the delay in getting to the point. >> We've got the three winners locked in and ready to go. >> You wanted the winners, so here they are. No more preamble. The three top projects are Endopath, Study Buddy, and Front Desk. >> Those three really stood out, addressing severe quantified pain points. >> All right, so this is incredible because it's not like this one agent we're used to talking to. It's you're talking to them and then the other person is responding. It's just you really feel they're real and it's just magical. But yeah, that's my last use case on what I do on my boot camp and I think it's the most my favorite thing to do on Notebook LM by far. This was really good. I actually didn't know they had that feature. So I again could think of so many like training use cases, lots of things. Um I love those little little podcast hosts. They've got such a vibe and this was such a great use case. Okay, I'm going to ask you our one lightning round question that we ask everybody and then I'm going to get you out of here because you're a busy busy lady. So, we've seen you you're a tool switcher. So, I know that you switch tools, but I have a question. When one of those tools is, you know, let's say Veo, Veo is giving you refrigerators with screens inside, with screens outside, with screens on your face, screens on your freezer, um, screens on your screens. When it's really not getting you what you want, what is your prompting technique? What do you do? The best thing you can do is just kill that instance and start over and use Gen AI to help you write the best prompt. So, I stopped trying to guess it myself and I use AI to help me with it. And the longer the prompt is, the better it's going to be and the less likely to have more iterations. So, yeah, use AI on AI. >> Okay. Kill it. Use AI and make it detailed. >> That's it. >> I love it. Well, thank you so much for joining us. Where can we find you? And then how can we be helpful? >> Please find me on LinkedIn. I post content on AI product management and AI building. But you can be helpful by asking people to join my boot camp. I have a cohort coming up in December. And as I said, people get three certifications and they get to actually build a full product and start their own company because I assign engineers to every team and you can build the product end to end. So it's this new tool that's coming out that is not going to need us to do tool hopping anymore. where you can do everything on this one tool and it's amazing and I can't wait to have people and see what comes out of it and what apps they create. >> Awesome. And I believe you can find that course. I think we're going to get you listed on Lenny's list if you're not already and it'll be at maven.com/lenny. So check out her course. It's going to be amazing for any PM that wants to do this amazing work very very fast. Thank you for joining us on how I AI. >> Thank you so much for having me. Thanks so much for watching.

    "description": "Lucas Werthein, the COO and co-founder of Cactus, shares how he built a personalized AI wellness coach using ChatGPT to optimize his athletic performance while managing past injuries. After multiple surgeries on his knees, shoulder, and foot, Lucas created a system that synthesizes data from medical imaging, blood tests, wearable devices, and nutrition plans to provide personalized recommendations. His AI coach helps him balance competitive tennis, weightlifting, and running a company while maintaining his goal of “feeling 25 in a 40-year-old body.” Lucas demonstrates how this approach transforms siloed health information into actionable insights that protect joints, optimize recovery, and extend peak performance.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. How to configure a ChatGPT with multiple data types, including MRIs, x-rays, blood tests, and wearable metrics, to create a comprehensive health profile\n2. A framework for setting clear performance boundaries that prioritize joint protection, energy optimization, and injury prevention\n3. Techniques for using AI to balance nutrition around special events like social dinners while maintaining performance goals\n4. How to use images and videos to get AI feedback on physical symptoms and injury recovery timelines\n5.

    "transcript": "I have always been super active into sports really constantly pushing myself to the limits of what my body can do and naturally that means injuries right and for me it became a little bit too much and so as soon as Chachi PT launched I started experimenting with aggregating this data so that I can get a more clear synthesis of what I can do to actually optimize the body. One of the things that I have never seen anybody do yet. I've seen a lot of folks drop in their daily workouts or their food diaries, but I have not seen MRIs and imaging here. And what important context for somebody who's an athlete to say, not only is this how I'm performing on an output basis, but this is actually like the structural setup under the hood. So, it's really interesting that combination of data into these files. >> I'm wanting to demand of my body to feel like 25 in a 40year-old's body. And it's interesting to think what if every person could have a coach that organizes all this action into clarity, right? And part of what we've been talking about is that not everyone is looking for this type of performance. Most people don't need six-packs or match prep, but they could use help with the basics, right? Eating less, processed food, sleeping better, moving more. And I think an AI coach could meet people where they are and actually give them the necessary nudges and contextualization of information that they need to be a better version of themselves. [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. [music] Today we have Lucas Worthing, head of technology at Cactus, who has done work for basically everybody, Apple, Coca-Cola, MTV, and even Beyonce herself. But today, we're not going to talk about product development. We're going to talk about how Lucas has built a wellness coach inside Chat GBT to optimize his nutrition, his workouts, and keep him feeling 25, even though he's a little bit older than that. This is a really fun episode with some practical insights for people just trying to make their lives better with AI. Let's get [music] to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. AI has already changed how we work. Tools are helping teams write better code, analyze [music] customer data, and even handle support tickets automatically. But there's a catch. These tools only work well when [music] they have deep access to company systems. Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across [music] internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that raises serious security concerns. [music] That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, access [music] controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise features. Building all that from scratch, [music] it's a massive lift. That's where Work OS comes in. Work OS gives you drop-in [music] APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale up [music] market faster. Think of it like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Cursor are already using WorkOS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. [music] Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at works.com. Start building today. Lucas, welcome to How I AI. Thanks for being here. Thank you. Uh glad to be here and thank you so much for inviting me to be on this wonderful podcast and show. >> What I'm excited about is so much of how I AI so far has really been how I AI for business and I really want to show your use case because it really is a personal how I AI and how you can actually use AI in your daily life to really make improvements and build something for yourself. And so tell us about the story that got us to what you're going to show us today. >> I have always been super active into sports and and would consider myself a pretty competitive person and so that means really constantly pushing myself uh to the limits of what my my body can do and and how much I can deal with in terms of the the stress of of these sports. Um, and naturally that means injuries, right? And so I've had surgeries on my foot to surgeries on my knees, um, surgery on my shoulder. And this is through through various sports from surfing, uh, to Muay Thai, uh, to playing tennis, weightlifting, and kind of changing it up over the years as the injuries come and needing to move into new sports. And we were, you know, joking about this before the show, but obviously as we enter 40, um, things start becoming a little bit more dire and you start paying attention more attention to how your body feels and reacts daily to the things that you didn't feel before. And I started becoming really obsessed with how I could optimize my body. You know, I'm 40 years old. I'm running a company. I play competitive tennis. I lift weights and I'm recovering from all these old injuries. And I'm trying to keep up with these teenagers on the tennis court playing these amateur tournaments and running around. And I'm I'm I'm wanting to demand of my body to feel to feel like 40 um to feel like 25, sorry, uh in a 40 year old's body. And you know, data is so siloed um and to make sense of everything that people tell you, that professionals tell you, and put it together is actually really hard, right? You get blood tests, you go to the nutritionist, you go to the physical therapist, um you get data from your wool, you know, nutrition plans, inbody scans. And for me, it became a little bit too much. And so as soon as the GP chat GPT launched um I started experimenting with aggregating this data so that I can get more a more clear synthesis of what I can do to actually optimize the body right because the problem isn't the lack of data the problem is the lack of synthesis and putting it all together and I started having a few breakthroughs actually and it started helping me feel better and perform better and I just started using it on a on a daily basis. So, you know, it came from a need of getting injured and trying to perform and getting back on the horse to now actually having interesting technologies that are allowing me to to to have really really specific actions that I can take to actually perform better. And what I want to reflect on before we get into actually what you built, which is going to be really interesting to see, is, you know, you strike me as a person and you've described yourself as a person that is pretty proactive about seeking out data, seeking out advice, going to medical professionals, getting different advice, reading. And so, it's not that you're not informed. It's not that you don't have access to experts, but for all this data and all this effort and all this access, you were still struggling a little bit with with some things here and there. And it's pretty amazing to me that what you're telling me is, you know, even given that whole portfolio of things that I've put against my my body and my wellness goals, this AI tool that I built was actually one of the things that helped me unlock a couple things that had been bothering me for for a really long time. So, I'm really interested that, you know, that last mile of optimization is really being driven by by this tool that you built. And it's it's pretty cool to see somebody who um is a deep expert still get a lot of value out of out of going even further. >> It's it's it's a really interesting conversation because I think we all see it in our numerous interactions in the field of health and wellness. You know, you were describing that you you do a lot of PT. I'm dealing with an elbow injury right now. And I was having a conversation with my PT today and they were telling me about a patient that had to have surgery for their elbow after a while. And I said, you know, it's really interesting because the the doctor makes the diagnosis. You guys are treating the patient, but this person needed to go into surgery because there there's a missing link. There wasn't someone looking at this guy's stroke and saying, \"Well, you need to change your tennis grip like this or you need to change essentially a biomechanic specialist, right?\" And and and to me that's really interesting because there there is always a lack of communication and the information is a little bit siloed. And I think that what I'm about to show when you start thinking about the possibilities of of how this can scale even to not through performance, you know, we're talking about the edge of the edge of the edge of trying to gain a little bit to to to be better. Um, but we're going to I can talk more about that, but I I think it's really interesting how, you know, essentially this is a performance strategist, right? It's it's trained to personally think about my joints, optimize my energy, extend my peak, and you'll see that it it answers me filtered through rules I've created. Um, and that helps me to sort of compile all this information that is usually really desperate and really separate. But yeah. >> Okay. So, let's actually let's go ahead and and show it because I'm really interested to see how you got to something that meets your standards, which from what I can hear are are quite high. So, you're going to pull up your screen and show us this well coached GPT that you built. >> Yeah. Well, let's let's get into it. Let me um let me dive into this. So when I configured this this GPT, I set it a few files that were important um for it to have the context of what I wanted um information to be reflected on, right? And so here you'll see that it has an X-ray of my left knee, my left knee, my right knee. It has my physiological cycles. This is a CSV file coming in from Whoop data. on my journal entry. So, what I describe in my dayto-day, am I stressed, do I have anxiety, did I sauna, did I do compression therapy, my workouts that are logged on a daily basis, and essentially my strain and how hard I work, and my sleep data on how much good sleep I get, sleep, deep sleep. So, a lot of lot of data being fed into into here. In addition to that, I mentioned I had a couple of knee surgeries. So, it has the MRI of my knee pre-surgery, postsurgery, and it has a few blood exams from uh this year and last year. So, three different blood exams. So it can compare the evolution of the tests and how I'm doing in addition to a nutritional plan from a nutritionist/dietitionian that helps me think about food as fuel and how I can perform better based on on fuel and an inbody scan that essentially measures um percentages of fat and muscle and distribution um across the body. And so it's using all these files um to think about to have context around myself. And so that that was an important element to be able to gather this data manually inputed into this GPT. >> What I think is interesting about this for folks that are listening or watching are a couple things. One is all this data is in all these different formats, right? So you have imaging data from MRIs and X-rays. You have like semistructured data from sleep, from a wearable. Um, you have blood tests in PDF form where it's got to parse a bunch of stuff, a textual nutrition plan. And what I love about AI now for people that maybe haven't built some of these tools for themselves is you can just dump all that data in. You don't have to worry about is it clean, is it organized, is it structured, just put it in. And then one of the things that I have never seen anybody do yet. I've seen a lot of folks drop in like their daily workouts or their food diaries, but I have not seen MRIs and imaging here. And what important context for somebody who's an athlete to say not only is this how I'm performing on an output basis, but this is actually like the structural setup under under the hood. So it's really interesting that combination of of data into these files. And then how is this GPT set up to actually work? What are the instructions? Would you walk us through that? >> Yeah, just to add something. I think you mentioned something really interesting around how the data is structured and it's also coming in from different languages, right? Um because I spend a lot of time in Brazil. Some of my exams aren't in Portuguese. Um a lot of them are in English, but some of them are in Portuguese. And so I don't need to worry about that either. Um I just dump it in and it process that information. Um, and so I I think that's also a valid point about how easy it is now to to port that data into something that can unify it. Yeah, you're absolutely right. Let me tell you about how I configure this, right? And so I'm telling you to act as my performance strategist and health optimization coach. It has access to my physiology, labs, imaging, wearables, and I want it to coach me like I'm a high performance operator. That's really important. I'm not trying to be a professional athlete. I wanted to understand that I want to perform, but I'm balancing I'm balancing tennis, lifting, recovery, and mainly running a company which takes the majority of my time. And I I don't want to be the most competitive person in the world. I don't want to be the best. My main objective is for it to safeguard my my joints and to amplify my output and to extend my peak. I want to feel healthy and painfree. That's super important. But I do want to perform like a 25year-old in a in the body of a 40-year-old. So I give it that that that instruction. Um when when I share my prompt, um I wanted to interrogate it through my context, right? looking at my my blood exams, my scans, my whoop, um other um specific information that it has. I wanted to flag what we call red and yellow zones, right? Um we see this in a lot of wearables or early signs of overtraining, under fueling, inflammation, and it's important. I want high ROI actions. Um no fluff, no hacks, nothing that hasn't been proven. And I want to be kept inside this zone where I'm moving painfree. I can play high output tennis. I don't break down. >> I'm [clears throat] I want to reflect to you something that one I think is personally interesting and two I think is interesting from a prompt perspective. So you know the top of your prompt is very common. You act like a blank. You are a blank. That sort of instructive point to the LLM to give it a role. What I think is really interesting about this last bullet point here is it's the opposite side of that coin, which is at the end of this, I want to be X, Y, and Z. And so, you know, say you're a performance coach. That's the kind of your role. My role is I'm running a company. I want to feel 25 in a 40-year-old body, and I want to be rested, move painfree, and play tennis. Like, it's a very clear input output structure. And then the human in me wants to reflect. These are very reasonable, nice goals. So again, you know, we're talking about this like hyper optimization and at the end of the day, you want to wake up, you want to feel good, you want to engage in your company, and you want to be able to play the sport that you want to play. And so I think the kind of idea of like a a role and then a really realistic outcome for yourself is a nice framing for something like this kind of personal coach prompt. >> Absolutely. and super important for it not to tell me to go get ozone therapy um or to go sit inside a hyperbaric chamber. Um which which may work. I'm not necessarily giving it a ding. Um >> but I I do want things that that are accessible in my dayto-day. Yeah. >> Um and that are proven that are scientifically backed. That's really important to how I wanted to think about um the recommendations. >> Yeah. And the other thing I see a lot when people prompt is they go to these extremes where they're like you are the best in the whole world and you're going to make me the most elite blah blah blah. And you know what I like about this is you're saying I'm getting good outcomes by like pulling in the bounds of reason on both sides of the hose and having reasonable roles and reasonable expectations. So it's a really good insight from a prompting perspective. Uh let's go down and show me show me what you optimize for. >> Yeah. So so I think part of this is the context that that I mentioned of how for example it has my nutrition plan, right? And so when you think about performance, so much performance is about how you eat and how you rest. And so having the basis of how I wanted to eat has been absolutely fundamental for to think about the recommendations, right? And so I wanted to stick to my nutrition plan unless there's data a driven reason to adapt. Um so this is all based on fueling and avoiding inflammation, right? I wanted to prioritize energy, um stable glucose, uh low inflammation and muscle retention. Number two, thinking about training and load management. You you can't overtrain. If you overtrain, you burn out. And so I needed to think about balancing strength, endurance, and mobility. Um, is I need to protect my knees and my shoulders and my joints, which have been messed with in in surgery. And so when thinking about recommendations, um, we can't overload um, the HRV. We can't be outside of sort of the readiness score. Um, and I need it to help me pull back because I will overtrain. I I I do want to get better and better and better, right? And so one of the things we hear about the most when studying and thinking about um performance is people don't pay enough attention to recovery and to rest. And so this is super important for me. The third one again going back to recovery and regeneration is uh sleep is the main factor here right and yes PT mobility sauna cold massages mindfulness need to be important and not optional they're part of the training cycle because they're part of recovery so I need recommendations of how to have it give me nudges so I can maintain those up on my dayto-day and lastly these this idea of of tracking and and feedback loops it's integrating data across well inbody labs diet journal entries and I needed to cross validate the decisions and not recommend something that is not aligned um with what I have said it just like from pulling some random thing from the internet >> one of the things I I want to reflect on here that I've said in other podcasts more in sort of a business context is when people are designing these GP PTS I really read these prompts and I'm like oh they reflect like the perfect employee or they reflect the perfect team. And when I'm looking at this this sort of reflects how in an ideal world all these experts that are supporting you your doctor your PT your coach would all be fully integrated aligned on a strategy like consistent in their recommendations databacked. But the reality is when you bring a team of individual experts together, one, they're all going to come with their unique point of view. Two, it's very hard just just tactically to stay aligned on recommendations and kind of resolve things across the board. And so what I like about this is, you know, ideally you'd be able to sit all those experts in a room with you and say, \"Hey, hey guys, this is how I want you to take care of me.\" But because that's not actually practical, what you're doing is bringing some of the data and the insights those people have your own ambitions and goals and then sort of like putting it in the system that will operate optimally for you uh over time. >> Absolutely. and and we'll talk more about the vision and and and a little bit of provocation of where I think this will will go and how this is a a prototype of something that um will be much bigger and that many many um practitioners, health systems, physicians will adopt in the future. >> Yeah. Okay. And then you do what everybody does, which is you give it a bunch of stuff to do and then a bunch of stuff to not do. >> Exactly. So hard hard boundaries, right? No pushing past the volume and intensity. One metrics show under recovery. My whoop is showing a red or yellow. I can't go train hard. Don't get any supplements that are unknown. Don't, you know, don't tell me to go take uh creatine or anything that although super popular at the moment, right, that that we we don't know is absolutely measurable, scientific backed and has ROI, don't give me novelties. Um stick to to what actually works to perhaps even ancient data and act on red flags. Uh if if I tell you there's a lot of soreness or low HRV or decreased sleep quality, that means perhaps I'm getting sick. Don't don't push when I can't push. >> Yep. Great. And I think this again for people I'm just kind of giving the meta commentary which is it's a very common prompt structure for anybody trying to build something for themselves is like give you a role give the GPT role give it a goal um give it some input and data give it uh an anti-prompt I say which is like tell it what not to do and then I like that you're closing on like the the check that it's all following the rules and this is how I want you to respond piece. So we can go through that really quickly and then maybe show a couple examples. >> Totally. So values, right? Precision, energy, adaptation, kinetics, all about movement. It's all about energy. It's all about precision. And then the tone, right? Like a coach. Be clear, tactical, no fluff, no lectures. Connect the dots. That's super important about everything that we're talking about. And prioritize what matters on this week, not vague long-term theory around what's possible. >> Great. And so, you know, it's very clear you put a lot of thought into this. Did you also use Chat PT to help you like craft the structure of this prompt >> many times? >> Yeah, I I I can tell from the emojis. Uh, >> the emojis, >> you can always tell. This podcast is supported by Google. Hey everyone, Shishta here from Google Deep Mind. The Gemini [music] 2.5 family of models is now generally available. 2.5 Pro, our most advanced model, is great for [music] reasoning over complex tasks. 2.5 Flash finds the sweet spot between performance [music] and price and 2.5 Flash Light is ideal for low latency, high volume tasks. Start building in Google AI Studio at a.dev. >> Okay, awesome. So, this is a great deep dive into instructions and I hope people are paying attention to it because one, like what a great prompt. Thank you for sharing. is super useful and two just the structure of it is very classically uh uh well set up for setting up a GBT. So whether it's this topic or another one I think people can learn a lot from how you've set it up. So how does it work? Show show me what what are common things that that you would do with this GBT. >> Yeah, let me give you let me give you an example. I'll give you a few fun ones here. Um, so this morning I I woke up and my wife told me that we have a a birthday dinner that we need to attend. Um, good friends of ours going to celebrate an Amakasi uh birthday dinner, which means plenty of rice and saki. And so how should I manage my day to balance the fact that I'm going to indulge in the evening? And this may be simple. Um but actually it's really interesting that it it thinks about how to change my actual diet. Right? In the morning I would usually eat something post training, but here it's saying basically like eat only protein, minimal carbs. Um at lunch it's saying the same thing. And so it's guiding me how to go along my day um based on the fact that I'm going to indulge in the evening um and have something that's going to be a little bit different and not necessarily feel destroyed. And so it's prepping me for something that's going to happen. And it's really useful because I don't have to think about it. I prompt it. I asked it. It gives me a response and I try to adapt, right? And so okay, great. It told me to have um no carbs. I took a picture of my breakfast. A little bit of eggs, avocado, coffee. Um, and then it it feeds me information about, okay, that's fantastic. Add a little bit of pepper for inflammation. You know, I'm very cognizant also that uh this is this is most people um not what most people need, right? If we think about most people, they perhaps just need to move a little bit more, sleep a little bit better, not eat processed food. Um, and I I I'm very cognizant also that this is for something very specific that I'm personally looking for, but it's very useful to how I can then program my day and how I can think about the next day as well. Well, I think the other thing is yes, your goals are maybe um a higher level of what the kind of like baseline person might have for their own performance health goals. And at the end of the day, the like I'm going to a birthday party later and I don't want to feel crummy tomorrow. Are there any things that I can do before this birthday party to keep me from feeling crummy is like a very applicable problem? I think one. I think the second thing is, you know, it's a really ondemand coaches and nutritionists and experts are expensive. They are inaccessible to a lot of people. And just this sort of short loop like am I doing the right thing? You know, give me an answer. And I like this piece that you showed us, which is like, look, I did it. and you get like a very short blip of a good positive feedback loop can actually help people reinforce habits that I think compound over time. And so, you know, I do think something like this makes some of these like tactics, you know, that that sound very basic a little bit more accessible, a little bit easier to implement and gives you sort of an ondemand feedback loop that as social human beings we we respond to. And so I don't think it's kind of too too far a ground from what most people would find useful. >> I think that's a that's a great point. And the fact that you now have a coach in your pocket is super interesting because things change. >> Um, another scenario I said it the other day is I said I was going out to dinner. I prepped the day, but there was a change of plans and we went to a party and we were going to drink and have a bunch of ginonics and get home at 3:00 a.m. and I didn't need to think so much about what I needed to do because I prompted it gave it that information and then it reacted based on that change of plan. And so having that be accessible now to so many people whether you are able to make that change at home because you have access to food. But even if you know you need to go eat at Chipotle and it can tell you the things that you can eat or that you should order at Chipotle because that is your only option. I think is a super interesting point of just how accessible um good information for you to be optimal um is becoming. >> So I would love to see I think this is a really great sort of like day-to-day practical example. I'm curious if you have anything that shows a little bit more of the kind of like physiology side of things. You know, you mentioned a lot at the beginning injuries and protecting joints and making progress. has have has any of that come into play in in your coaching? You know, we see the the nutrition side, but I'm curious if there's anything else there. >> Totally. Um, let me show you. >> What I also want to call out for folks that I love as you're scrolling is context changing, content changing. It's like, now I want to talk about nutrition. Now I want to take a screenshot of my workouts. Now I want to do do this and do that. and and the chat can kind of adapt to all that information and not need you to follow any rules or any schedule or any structure. So, I think that's really interesting. And then I love that this is in Portuguese some of it and then switches to English. Uh I I caught that on the screen share. >> So, I think this one's really interesting. Um I have been dealing with not a tennis elbow but an elbow injury and um I went to a doctor. I I gave it um the diagnosis of the doctor. Um I gave it the prescription of physical therapy and basically I talk about my pain. I would talk about my pain on a daily basis and I would take pictures and I would record movies of how I'm feeling pain and basically it would confirm what the doctor um has said you know I tell it the doctor discarded tennis elbow um and it's like you know I've been I've been off the courts for a week how much longer and the doctor has told me and the PT has told me but I'm trying to test it if if it's going to say something different and it's saying the same thing and really frustrated you know, I'm following all the prescriptions. I'm I'm doing all the exercises, but it's like it's not not getting better. And then one day, I actually go into PT and it does feel better because of something specific that they did with electrical currents and strength training at the same time. And so now I'm prompting it to think about if, you know, based on the evolution of the recovery that I've been telling it, will I be able to play this amateur tournament that I I want to play on September 18th? And so it's thinking about how many weeks are left, what's realistic, you know, decision checkpoints, um what it thinks, and then I ask it to put put everything on the table to think about the recovery um the recovery uh plan um for for how we're going to do this. And honestly, it is exactly the same thing the PT told me, which is really interesting. But it is contextualized in a way that I can digest. And now sort of the anxiety of me every day thinking, man, is the pain gone? Is the pain gone? Is the pain gone? Is eved a little bit because I can manage the expectations of what will happen in just a very visual manner that you don't usually get um from your PT or from your doctor. And so I'm contributing it this information so it can think like them but perhaps process and synthesize the data a little bit better because it has so so much knowledge about myself and what I'm doing and how I act. >> Yeah. One of the, you know, I want to just go back and reflect on what you just showed us because I think there's a couple really interesting things here for people to listen to. One is I think people really underuse what you just showed, which is a video or a picture circling a thing into into chat GBT. I found that that's such a useful um a useful kind of workflow for folks that are new to AI and not sure what it can do for it. Uh I don't know if this is an appropriate metaphor or not, but I live in a 114year-old house. It's like very similar to living in my 40-year-old body. And uh we you know we have leaks here or cracks there or bubbles here or whatever and I'm constantly taking a picture of something circling it and saying what could this you know tell me what this could be. And so you can do that you know I have a it's not tennis elbow it's I sit at my laptop elbow um and put my my arm on my desk at a bad angle. I know I do it. Um, but taking that and just saying like I've got pain here, not not here, not here, but like here. Um, what could that possibly be is really good use case. I think people also don't know. Uh, a lot of these models can process video really well and so that is another input you can put in and you know kind of do the thing that they make you do at PT which is like I can go to here but not further or I can do this. So I think that's a really interesting workflow. I think the second thing people are using chat GBT for a lot is just validating expert opinions. Not to dismiss expert opinions. But you know what? My, you know, personal doctor is not on demand 24 hours a day. When I leave the office, that's about as much as I'm going to get for them. So being able to go back and saying, \"Can you reexlain this to me? Is there anything else it could be?\" Uh, just gives you a more accessible outlet for sort of validating some of that stuff. And then the last thing I would say is often when you leave a certainly in the health profession but an expert and they give you some takeaways, right? They give it to you in the format they give it to you. They explain it to you verbally. They text it to you. They give you a little takeaway sheet and you're like, \"No, I want this, but I need it in a dayby-day plan until September.\" Or, \"Can you reexplain this to me in this format?\" And I also think this ability to grock the same information through a different format by having an LLM translate it, it's really useful, especially when it's information from an expert where you may not understand the terms or the language or the mechanics. And so I think those three things are really interesting use cases of of AI and you can see them all in just this one flow. I think that's a really fantastic point and I think we can extrapolate and think about what what I'm doing here for myself. You know, manually uploading MRIs, whoop data labs just exposes a much bigger opportunity. Um, and and AI could be a a missing synthesizer of personal health. And I think that healthcare has obviously an inter interoperability problem and the data is siloed. And it's interesting to think what what if every person could have a coach that that organizes all this action into into clarity, right? And part of what what we've been talking about is that not everyone is looking for this type of performance. Most people don't need six-packs or match prep, but they could use help with the basics, right? Eating less, processed food, sleeping better, moving more. And I think an AI coach could meet people where they are and actually give them the necessary nudges and contextualization of information that they need to be a better version of of themselves. >> Well, what's really funny about this is I'm thinking about you as, you know, a more high performance athlete operator. I was just reflecting, I want to make this for my 8-year-old wants to get much better at basketball. Like that's his performance school. I'm like, oh, you could take the same framework, right? He's eight. He's got this much time. You know, we have to walk to the basketball court. What what do we do? And you can do everything from videos to to um you know, pictures, all that kind of stuff. And so, I think it's just really interesting to think about this. no matter what your goals are, setting up a framework like this that can help you day by day increment your way to them. So before we before we wrap this up, you know, you've you've kind of um talked about it a little bit, but you know, what do you think the future of this is? Are everybody going to make this themselves? Do you think there's a product here? Like what what do you think is the gap between I have a GBT and everybody can kind of do this on their own? Yeah, I I think there's a really interesting notion when you think about this and you think about how this can potentially scale in the near future. I I see a vision in which in five years or less everyone will have access to a personal AI health coach and not to replace doctors but to help us show to doctors um show up more informed and to live healthier between visits and to make these micro decisions every day. Additionally, I do think that the doctors will also have this and so our AI will talk to the doctor's AI and it's interesting to think about what are the spaces that need to be designed and what type of interactions will occur once that happens. It's going to be a different world because they will have all the context. Um they will meet have on all the context and when the doctor and the patient show up there's just much more clarity. um to have the conversation. And so I think that the the the future of health isn't just about medical breakthroughs. It's a lot about synthesis and the ability to turn this overwhelming amount of data into something that's simple and very very personalized. I also believe in an era of seamless capture. You know, we're talking about manually uploading all these things to the GPT, but it will be seamless. We will have micro sensors around potentially in your bloodstream, tracking information, glucose, hormones, smart fabrics, eventually toilet sensors, measuring microbiome, hydration, and it will all be ambient, passive, and invisible. And I think that there's a world where the healthc care leaders will eventually sell their knowledge as trained AI models. You know, imagine having a coach in your pocket that's been trained not just on you, but on decades of patient data from institutions like Mayo Clinic or Advent Health. >> Yeah. Um it it it's it's just really interesting to think about what happens when you combine that passive data and you put it next to the guidance that's grounded in the best medical science and personalized to you. And I think this also gives the ability for the doctor to get out from in front of the computer and be a storyteller and a long-term strategist and to have this hyper personalized aspect around food, supplements, habits. Um, and so I I think that I laugh because I think that in 10 years we'll look back and talk um about how much manual effort we've put into health tracking and we'll think about just like no one today types in GPS coordinates into their phone, no one will manually log boards or meals and health data will capture itself and we will have coaches in our pockets to go um back and forth and and evolve. And so just last words, I do think that's important to reflect that this is absolutely not about gimmicky. Um it's it's really a precision tool for consistency. I am looking for high ROI choices and it's helping me do that through injuries or food. And I do think that when we think about a potential population level impact, that's where this becomes powerful to imagine um what this can be. Um and it's actually something that my company does quite a bit. And you know, maybe maybe this is not the place to talk about it, but it it's something that I'm seeing a a fast adoption to how health systems and wellness companies and doctors are thinking about this. I think there's there's a brave new world coming. >> Well, I'm I'm excited for for that world. I was just think I I spent a hot minute in health tech and I was like, where is my FHI Epic uh uh MCP that I can plug into uh and then and then I'm going to go wild. But again, I I think that is a future. I want to bring it back to people who are maybe watching the podcast saying, \"How does this apply to me? I'm not an athlete.\" And and just the use cases that I think of are caregiving. When you're a caregiver of an elderly relative, you have so much information, so many specialists, so much points of data that you have that PE, you know, you go visit, you have pictures, you have recordings, you have all this stuff. And just having this this coach to maybe help with a caregiving journey is one. I think kids are super interesting. I think athletics is very interesting. I think there's probably product market fit for people that um apparently there are many on this podcast recording right now that are 39 turning 40 but want to be 25. Um and so I just think like you know maybe people listening don't have the exact same goals but the framework really applies to a lot of healthcare and wellness challenges um or or goals for people. So I'm really excited that you showed this to me. It gave me so many I have so many ideas. I won't bore everybody with my um achy hip and elbow, but I have and and sleep issues uh which I can attribute to my kids. But I think it's it's a really interesting and it's inspired me to want to go build a couple of these for different different coaching topics I have. Okay. Well, we are this was fa fabulous. I want to do kind of three lightning round questions. One is just you mentioned a couple other workflows. So, this is your your favorite, but can you just tell me a couple other maybe that you use in work? Uh, maybe flash us one or two that you think are are interesting that people can think about. >> Yeah, absolutely. Um, I'm also happy to share um the prom so that you and others um can configure their own GBTs. >> Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes. Cactus is a firm that works at the intersection um of physical space and digital technology and we work for healthcare and wellness uh developing uh essentially digital products and thinking about physical space. It's an intersection of a consulting firm and a design firm. And so many times we're thinking about new products, new services for our clients. And this is an example where we have taken the client who is a brilliant fantastic doctor but she is extremely busy and so we have synthesized a lot of this information from articles and other podcasts and things that are available on the internet. And we have seted this information so that we can ask it questions when she's unavailable and try to get the work to 80 or 90% of where we think she would agree with so that when we present it to her, it's not taking time that could be skipped over because we have a lot of how she thinks and how she makes decisions. >> I I love this. We have seen one or two synthetic bosses on on the podcast and I love this from a kind of like consulting firm, design firm perspective, which is like synthetic clients are very interesting ways because as you said, you know, just going back to everything we've been talking about, your experts not always available, your clients not always available, people's time is scarce. But if you know enough about how they might react to information, you can not only give yourself some insight, but you can also give um your team insight into how they might react to things. And then, you know, I I I love these uh as people make them for their bosses or for their clients. A little pro tip to the bosses and clients out there, you want you want to make this even easier, make one of yourself that you can share with people. um because you probably have the best understanding of what's important to you and how things matter. And so it's one of those tips I tell everybody to do is go replicate yourself in a GPT to give your team a first-line passive feedback and then sometimes you end up like me whereas you build that GPT and then it accidentally becomes an enterprise software software business which is how my company started. So, I think this is a this is a great idea. And then one other thing we you we talked about before the show and maybe you can just voice over what you do here is you have an AI co-founder as well. So, lots of synthetic people. Tell us a little bit about that. >> Yeah, my I love my my co-founders. They're they're brilliant. Um and I do not need uh an an AI co-founder, but this is a new world that we're living in. the the the the company that we run is a distributed firm. We're no longer in an office and we no longer have access to each other. Um you know, by going and and tapping on them and saying, \"Hey, do you have a minute?\" And you have to schedule a call or call them. And many times you just need a little bit of a partner to think about a potential thorny problem um that you would only think with your co-founder. And it's really interesting to load it up with data around how your co-founder thinks, how you think, some of the problems that you're going through, and being a voice to brainstorm with you so that you're not starting from a blank slate, which is something obviously you hear a lot, but it's really helpful. It's almost like business therapy. >> Yeah. Well, on that point, I'm laughing to myself cuz as you were describing this, I was thinking, \"Oh, maybe I can save my husband a little bit of trouble if I make a synthetic Claire.\" And he just double checks like, \"Should I should I say or do this to Claire before before I do it?\" But I I do think that there we're this interesting world where you know wanting the expertise of someone on demand is is not always possible and AI has made an approximate version of that possible and it's not you know it's not the real thing. Um but it does help you in in the moment. um especially in a distributed world where you know you don't want to atmentntion your colleague in Slack at you know 11:00 when you're thinking about a problem and so I found similarly that AI can be a really great uh again co-pilot or partner um in some of those moments where you just need a quick check >> can I just mention going back just just to the synthetic client uh just so I don't get in trouble with with my clients it's important to highlight that >> none of the information that we put in the synthetic client are proprietary. They're all available on the internet. And so we're not training any of the models with the information that we get from our clients. It's just an exercise that we run through presentations publicly available. Yeah. So >> um >> yeah. >> Well, this is awesome. you you know I'll wrap with our our final favorite question which is you are clearly an expert prompter which I love to see but when your coach is giving you bad advice or you know the AI is not responding how you like you seem like a very reasonable person so you probably act quite politely but what is your go-to tactic how do you how do you get AI back on track um do you ever find yourself frustrated what do you do >> not frustrated um and I think this ties to how the models have evolved as we see the iteration of models. I see definitely an evolution of how it hallucinates less or it makes up less things. I do think that putting guard rails around how we're allowing it to think and not necessarily access outside information makes it a little bit easier. Um, and so when it gets something wrong, um, I see it as the evolution of technology. This is brand new technology. It's going to get it wrong. And I try to perhaps help it like I help my children when they when they get things wrong. >> I I have said this consistently on this podcast. The answer to that question is always a reflection of your parenting tactics and and strategies. Well, Lucas, this has been amazing. Thank you so much for sharing your coach. I'm actually going to go spin off into Chad GBT. I have a really good idea for one that maybe I'll share in the show notes as well. I appreciate you joining How I AI. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Well, you can find me at I'm actually off social media. >> Um, >> so we can't social media. >> Where can we find your company? >> You can find my company. It's captive. As in Sam. Um, and that's where I spend most of the my time to be honest. So, if you want to find me, just just go to Cactus. >> Great. Go to Cactus and find him at that amateur tournament, tennis tournament on September 18th. >> Or or challenge me to to a tennis match. That's that's the other way to get my attention. >> Yeah. >> Perfect. Well, thank you so much for joining. I really appreciate this. It's been a great conversation. >> All right. Thanks, Claire. It's a pleasure to meet you and thanks for having me on the show. It's been wonderful. >> Thanks so much for watching.

    "transcript": "[music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. [music] Today we have a very special pre-Thanksgiving episode of How I AI, where I show you how to use Lovable to Vibe Code a personalized party hub for your upcoming dinner party. I share some of my own personal tips and tricks on how to uplevel the designs of any vibecoded app using Google fonts and midjourney. [music] And then I share my personal favorite trick for using chat GPT to [music] make recipes easier to make. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by work OS. [music] AI has already changed how we work. tools are helping teams write better code, analyze customer data, and even handle support tickets automatically. [music] But there's a catch. These tools only work well when they have deep [music] access to company systems. Your co-pilot needs to see your entire codebase. Your chatbot needs to search across internal docs. And for enterprise buyers, that raises serious [music] security concerns. That's why these apps face intense IT scrutiny from day one. To pass, they need secure authentication, access controls, audit logs, the whole suite of enterprise [music] features. Building all that from scratch, it's a massive lift. That's where work OS comes in. Work OS gives you [music] drop-in APIs for enterprise features so your app can become enterprise ready and scale up market faster. Think of it [music] like Stripe for enterprise features. OpenAI, Perplexity, and Cursor are already using WorkOS to move faster and meet enterprise demands. Join them and hundreds of other industry leaders at works.com. Start building today. With Thanksgiving just a week away, I thought I would use the idea of a Thanksgiving party hub vibecoded in lovable as a way to show you a couple tips and tricks on how to uplevel your prototypes and vibecoded software. Use some tools that are a little bit more fun than the ones we get to show every day and show off some of my personal tips and tricks when it comes to hosting, cooking, and building websites. Maybe my favorite things. So to get started, I thought about creating a Thanksgiving party hub. And I started this project with a very simple prompt in Lovable. Why did I pick Lovable? Well, I picked Lovable because usually, although unfortunately not in this exact instance, usually Lovable has a little bit nicer of a design component to it than other vibe coding tools. It'll bring in a little bit more color. And generally, I just think for personal projects, it has a little bit more humanity and personality to it. So, I prompted um Lovable to give me a Thanksgiving party hub for managing invites, dishes shared, recipes, and photos. So, if you're responsible for hosting a big holiday meal at your house, you know that you got to do a couple things. You got to figure out who's coming and honestly what they can eat at this point. You usually do something potluck, so you want to coordinate the dishes across your guests. Um, I have a tip on recipes I really want to share that I think is really fun. And then, of course, you want to have a photo gallery, which could be really cool. And so, I got this up before we started the show. And you can see here that lovable, thought through um modern event management apps and kind of brought some cozy holiday gathering to it with a warm autumn palette with orange, golden browns, rich browns. And it had the features for V1 that I listed in my original prompt, which was a welcome dashboard, a guest list, disc coordination, recipe sharing, photo gallery, and a warm inviting autumn aesthetic. Now, I don't think this is that great. So, one of the highlights of today's episode is going to be showing you a couple tips and tricks that I might use to really uplevel the design of a vibe coding or prototyping project that I might do. And I'm going to do this a little aside of what you might use in a company, which is bring your own design system to something. This is going to be a little bit more like how can you personally develop your design and taste as you develop these applications and what are some additional tools, tricks, etc. that you might not think of that would help you make your web designs or your application designs better. So, just looking at this, we don't love it. It's not the prettiest. Um, it's got a pretty pretty boring stock photo in the background. You can't really read it. Um, there's some layout issues in the navigation here. You can see this is butdding up against the border of the image. You know, it's just kind of boring. And one of the things that I think you can do to uplevel any design is get a really nice typography combination in your application. And something you might not know about these vibe coding tools like Lovable, Bolt, V0, Replet, etc. is they're all pretty well integrated with Google Fonts. So, one of the things that I really like to do when thinking about how to bring up typography into my apps is Google Google Font combinations. This will give you a combination of headline and body fonts that can be used. Licenses are free on the web or in an app that really already look great and have been designed and inspired by great designers. And so Canva has this awesome resource, this page that I go to a lot which just lists, you know, combo after combo of Google font combinations. So everything from sort of standard ones that might like look good on a SAS app to more fun um or media oriented ones to ones that might fit a personal application a lot better. And I want this to feel super super cozy. So I'm going to go with this homemade apple, which is a font, not a recipe yet. and railway font combination. I think it's really cute. It gives me sort of this like grandmother writing a recipe feeling and I know for a fact that lovable can access Google fonts. So what I would do in this instance is I would actually copy and paste these two font names. I would go back to lovable and say okay let's uplevel the design starting with typography. I want I can't type today. Um I want to use Google Fonts homemade apple for the headlines and railway for the body font. So, Laville should be able to interpret this and go ahead and embed the right fonts, the right scripts, the right structure to then uplevel the CSS and the typography for this design um using those two fonts that we identified. So, I'm excited to see what it comes up with. H so cute. Now, not as readable, but you know, honestly, I don't care. I think it's really, really, really adorable. And if you're curious about how this actually works, again, you can go into your fonts or you can go into your files. You can see it's pulled in the Google API's fonts. It's pulled in homemade apple and railway as a font. It's added those fonts as defaults in the Tailwind, which is our CSS kind of framework. Um, the Tailwind config and it's updated. I think if I find headlines, yep, headlines are going to now be that font homemade and body is going to be font railway. So again, what I like about this is it not only is a process for you to update your design and make it look great, but just by reading these three files, you can understand this is how I pull in Google fonts. This is how I configure them in Tailwind, which is very popular right now with um some of these apps. And then here's how I would set those default fonts in my CSS. So again, it's a combination of learning the design system and the code system through these vibe coding tools. And I think it looks pretty good. I think this just looks really cute and it makes me very happy. Now, one problem we have is that the Thanksgiving Party Hub header does not look great. It's really hard to read. Also, I definitely wouldn't call it the Thanksgiving Party Hub. So, I want to make two changes here. And in making those two changes, I want to go over to one of my favorite other tools, which is MidJourney. So, I don't love this stock photo at the top of leaves in a plate. Or maybe it's not a stock photo, maybe it's an AI generated photo, but I still don't I still don't like it. And I want to generate something more fun. And when I am working in midjourney, which is an AI photogenerating application, that honestly was the first thing that made me really excited about generative AI. It was one of the most inspirational tools I've ever seen. I like to use and look up style references on X. So, style references are little codes that you can append to the end of your midjourney prompts to generate a really cool aesthetic or image style. And there are so many people out on X that are sharing these really interesting, super cool looking style references and parameter strings that you can use to generate an image in a specific style. And one that I found um while researching this episode was this one by Michael Rabone, which is this like whimsy textured storybook paint kind of like paper cutout aesthetic. I thought it was super cute, very organic, gave me like cozy vibes, felt very kid-friendly, and so I wanted to generate an image like this. And you can see here it has this style reference, which is this long code that gets the image generation into a specific kind of stylistic or aesthetic space. And then he's also gone on and added um a couple other parameters like aspect ratio stylize parameter um what version of the midjourney model you might use. And so I just really love this and wanted to generate something like this. And so I actually created these before so we didn't have to wait. And I I copied the um the prompt almost exactly except I changed it to say geometric paper autoutuminal harvest table. And so I got this, I think, really really adorable image of like wheat in a vase and pumpkins and fruits and it just feels exactly like I wanted for my website and my image, but it's a square. And if we go back to my image, I really need this long this long thing. And this is real talk. I struggled. So, one of the things you can do if you have an image you like and you know the prompt generated it is you can go down here and I'll zoom in a little. You can go down here and say use prompt. So, I can actually reuse the prompt. And one of the things that I missed is that it had this hard-coded aspect ratio um parameter in here. So, I'm going to go ahead and delete that and then go into the settings and actually do a 2:1, which is a pretty wide aspect ratio image, but I'm going to use the exact same prompt because I thought it generated a really good result. And I'm going to go ahead and submit that. My journey has gotten super fast. Um, you can see below I've done a couple other ideas, but you'll see here now that same image style and prompt is going to be generated but in that wider aspect ratio. So, I think this is a really fun tip or trick for folks that are using MidJourney to generate images for specific instances is you can really tune the um metadata and the parameters of the image to make it fit for your design. Now looking at Oh my gosh, this is totally giving me California Thanksgiving vibes, which is like a pumpkin and the ocean and this beautiful it looks a little tuskcen, a little tuskcen hill. Um, and I really love this. I think it's super cute. So, I'm going to save this image and I want to replace my header image on this Thanksgiving party hub with this image. So, I'm going to say, okay, the header needs to be improved. Here is the image I want for the background. I also want the title of the page to be Claire's Thanksgiving feast and all the copy to be more personalized around Claire hosting Thanksgiving at home. And then I'm going to drag that image over and we're going to see if it takes it in and updates the image. So, I've uploaded that photo generated by Midjourney. It should be nice and wide for this. And I'm going to submit it and have it update that header. And again, these are just a couple really simple tips and tricks that are going to get you from what feels like a little bit like vibe coding slop to something much more beautiful, something much more well-designed, something that really feels like, you know, artisally crafted farm-to-table software, which is what we want all of our vibe coding apps to look like. So, it's going to take that image, it's going to personalize everything for Claire's Thanksgiving feast. It should be pretty fast. Again, once you have the framework for your application, I think it's really good to just little bit by little bit iterate on the components of your design to improve them over time. I think if you gave a big list of I don't like the typography and I don't like the header and I don't like this and I don't like that, um, it can get lost in actually generating what you want. But I think this incremental step by step is really helpful. Now again, I think this looks already so much better um than what we had before. It's so pretty. It's feels much more cozy. It feels like honestly just well much better designed. But we have this image problem [snorts] here that the text is clipped. And so I'm going to go ahead and take a screenshot, which is another trick I really like. Um and take a screenshot and say the headline text is being clicked. So, we're going to type that in. Text is being clipped. Please fix. Also, replace the star above the headline text with a pumpkin, not pumpkin, a pumpkin and leaf emojis. Pumpkin and leaf emojis. Now, I can't again my nails look very nice for the holidays. Cannot type. One of the benefits of AI is you can typo, you can misspell things, you can have really beautiful nails and it will not matter. So, this little how I AI uh tip for the ladies out there. And I realize I'm not on my paid lovable plan um which is on my other profile, but we're just going to do what we can do right now. So, it's going to fix the text clipping and replace the icon with pumpkin and leaf emote. H look at that. It's a little [laughter] It's a little Halloweeny. So, we might remove that pumpkin. Um, but hopefully it'll fix the text clipping um on the image and add proper spacing, which is what we want. And what I like about this is I thought the pumpkin would be really cute. I forgot that the pumpkin emoji um is by default a jacko'lantern. We are past Halloween now. If you haven't missed it, go back to our How I AI episode on a Halloween fortune teller app that was generated. Um but you know this is a little silly. So I am going to um go to what files were changed and I am actually just going to get rid of this little pumpkin. And then I'm going to come back in here and actually fix the line height to get the clipping issue fixed. So hopefully this hero headline will be fixed. It really doesn't want to work. And honestly, we're just going to let it let it be. So, we're going to go back to latest. We're going to accept that this is a little funky looking. We'll fix it later. But again, you can tweak this. This is just proof that sometimes vibe coding is not perfect, and I don't want to spend time today on optimizing this headline height. Okay, we're going to ignore that header for right now. But the last thing I do want to fix is this uh headline header nav. I think it's just a little funky looking. And so again, I'm going to just go in here. I took a screenshot of it. And I'm going to say the spacing at the bottom of the snap bar is a bit broken. Please fix. And then I feel like the buttons are just like a little light. So I'm going to ask them to make the buttons just a little bit darker. And I'm going to submit that. Hopefully that fix goes through. And we've gone from a pretty boring first design, which we can flash up, to a really beautiful, fully customized party hub with a bunch of features in here that we're going to expand on. And look at that. It didn't fix it at all. So again, with our vibe coding, something that I would probably do if I cared a lot more is I would go in and actually optimize the code here. I would read the code. I won't make you all watch me do this, but I would figure out what is going on with the images. Why is this not actually changing? And I would make those changes myself. But for now, I think it looks really cute. Again, we have a guest list, a dish coordinator, recipe collection, and photo gallery. The last idea I have for you before we go into recipes, which I think is really important, is adding dietary restrictions to your party hub. So, I don't know if you all are like me, but I have relatives that are vegan. I have a husband who is gluten-free, dairy free. I have a me that wants to eat everything on Thanksgiving. And so it's really great to be able to add these like little custom features that might not be in your standard invitation app here in Lovable. So I'm going to ask one more thing functionalitywise. I'm going to say, okay, we'll come back to design later. I don't know why I'm saying this. I just feel like I'm being polite. Um, let's add dietary preferences restrictions to the guest list. Let's start with a multi select of the most common ones. So, what this is going to do, in addition to adding guests with their name and email address, which is something that the app based off of its own knowledge of how other event apps work, it's actually going to add dietary preferences and restrictions to the guest list. And now one thing I call out for people is it is useful to have a language around user experience design and coding when explaining this. For example, if I just said add dietary preferences, it could add like a text field where you're typing it in or it might ask me what dietary preferences do I care about. instead here with this prompting I was pretty specific that I said let's start with a multi select of the most common ones and multis select means people can have more than one dietary preference which they do and I want to not come up with a list I want pe I want lovable to come up with a list for me so if I go to guest list um now I can select my dietary restrictions and select multiple ones here love it let's see if I can cover my husband so we got gluten free, dairyf free. Perfect. And then um my mother-in-law is vegan, so we got vegan vegan and then no restrictions as an option, which is great. And the last thing I might ask it to do is take these restrictions and add tags to the dishes so people can call out common allergens in in their dish or um ingredients this list might care about. Okay. So again, I'm taking one part of the data model from a form and I'm adding it to another part of the data model of the form. And the reason why I love vibe coding something like this so much is I don't really have to think about how those might interact. This app is going to be a lot smarter than I would be in the 30 seconds it's going to take to generate. to add that in kind of think about the interplay between a preference which would be something like dairyf free and an ingredient saying this contains dairy so it's not good for dairyf free or it is safe for dairyf free and so I think this is just a really nice way to again not just improve the design of an app but think about what aspects of a data model you could add to something to really customize it to make it useful to you personally so it's going to add these allergen tags to the dish manager. It's probably going to take a second for it to refresh and we will see what that looks like once it's live. Here we go. So, add dietary tags and allergens. Look, it just gave the exact answer we needed, which is let's just map it one to one to the dietary information. If it's dairyfree, mark it dairy free. If it's vegan, mark it vegan. If it's gluten-free, mark it gluten-free. And we can see here that now you can add things like mashed potatoes that are vegetarian and gluten-free. Thank you, Sarah. My husband will be very happy um here in the list. And so we can now start to see what kind of dishes are coming, who can eat them, will they meet our guest needs. We could do all sorts of interesting things here like list the names of people that could eat these dishes or even build a report on do we have enough coverage across all of our kind of categories of foods main sides and desserts or do we have enough coverage across our dietary restrictions so that my husband won't be hangry when he's at at Thanksgiving this year. But again, we're not going to show that. This is to really inspire you to take something a little bit further. The last piece I want to show you is one of my favorite flows for recipes. So, this is a bonus bow on the end of this Thanksgiving themed episode where I'm going to show you one trick to use using AI that I think is really great for recipes, especially if you're cooking with kids. So, Thanksgiving again is one of my favorite holidays. I love cooking for my family and I love cooking with kids. But one of the challenges I've always found using online recipes for kids is they're typically formatted like this. They typically have a list. Well, let's talk about like the the narrative structure, the kind of novel that goes before any online recipe. But let's say we get past that. It usually has a list of ingredients and measurements and then it has instructions. So let's say you're making chocolate chip cookies. It will say, you know, you need two cups of flour and 8 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of chocolate chips, etc., etc. And then the recipe will say, mix the flour and the chocolate chips. This is a terrible cookie recipe, but just go with me. And if you have kids, you know, you're scrolling up and down with dirty like dirty hands trying to figure out, well, how many chocolate chips, how much butter, how much flour, because the measurements and the instructions are split up separately. And this has been one of my personal favorite AI use cases, which is to bring those two things together and put them in an order that you can actually follow with your kids. So, I'm going to show you all Claire's favorite Thanksgiving recipe. It is this palenta and sausage stuffing. It's made of palenta, so it's corn, it's gluten-free. Um, you put sausage in it, you blend half of it, it's like chunky, creamy, crispy on the top. It is so delish. It's my favorite thing to make. Um, and I love having my kids help me make it. But again, you can see this recipe has the exact problem we talked about. It's got all these ingredients and numbers up top, but then when you're talking about exactly how to cook it, the the the um ingredient measurements are not in the same order. And so what I like to do, it's super simple. I really just copy and paste this recipe. You could also give chatbt the link. I'm gonna use 51, which came out last week. We didn't do an episode specifically on 51. Here's my general vibe on 51. It's got a better personality than five for sure. It's got a little bit more of that 40 cute energy. Not so many bullet points, which I love. It's a little too cute sometimes. So, I've noticed sometimes it brings sort of a sassy attitude. You can tune the quoteunquote personality of it a little bit, but like it brings a little bit of a personality to tasks that you might not want it to bring a personality to. So, I think that's problem one. Problem two, call it a problem or not a problem, is it is actually pretty quick to call a tool. And so what I found is especially 51 um auto or instant where it's like thinking right or it's not doing thinking or it's thinking very fast, it will just go right into the task. And usually I like a loop or two of questions or feedback. So that can be a matter of tuning both the model and the reasoning effort in these models. But right now we're just going to do auto. I don't think this needs to think very hard about rearranging this text. and we're going to paste in this recipe. So, I'm going to say here is a recipe. Please format it into a different structure. And then I'm actually going to go back to my app and remind myself of what I need. I need a title, description, prep time, servings, ingredients, and instructions. But I want the instructions to follow a specific format. So, I'm going to say title, description, cook time, ingredients, servings, and instructions. For instructions, I want them clearly in steps. Step one, step two, etc. And I want to make sure both the ingredients and the measurements are in line. So I do not have to go back and reference the ingredients list ingredients list. Okay. So I pasted that recipe in. I gave a very specific format that I wanted to do. If I was being really clever, I would probably create a custom GPT with these instructions for translating ingredients. If I was being very, very clever, I would go into my Lovable app and I would make an open AI call to auto translate and update these ingredients. So again, you can just imagine how this would kind of evolve over time if you really wanted to spend a lot of serious time on recipe generation or improving things. And again, this is just like quality of life that I think is so fabulous. So, let it it's decided it needs to think a little bit. We have the blinking dot. So, we'll come back as soon as this recipe is generated. While we're sitting here, I will make one comment about 51 that I've heard from a couple people that have spent a little bit of time comparing this to other models, which it thinks longer. It is a little bit maybe a lot bit slower than five. So again, think about your use case. I kind of feel like this is frozen. It's stressing me out. So I'm going to go ahead and stop. I'm going to see if I can try this again in a faster model. So let's just paste the same prompt. Let's change it to instant right away. Let's submit it again. One of my favorite prompting tricks, which is just bail and restart. All right, here you go. fully reformatted, clean structured with measurements embedded directly into each step so you never have to jump back to the ingredients. So, it got my user story perfectly. And look at this. So, for if you have a seven-year-old and you need to tell them to follow a recipe step by step, this is what we need. Bring six cups of water and two teaspoons salt to boil. Not water and salt, the exact amount. Bring in two cups of palenta. So again, this is just such a nice flow for reorganizing information for your brain that will allow you to be a little bit more efficient when cooking a giant meal on Thanksgiving. And let me just give you a couple ideas. I copied and pasted from a online um website recipe. You could pull out your recipe book, take a picture of the recipe, kind of like snap the few pages, upload those to ChatGpt. really reorder reorder this. And what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to add this over in our app. So, I'm going to go side by side. We'll go over to our app. We'll add it in and we will get you out of here to enjoy and prep your own Thanksgiving app and your own Thanksgiving meal. So, let's see how easy this is to pull over. I'm going to put my title. It gave me a nice description. Prep time is about an hour. Servings 8 to 10. Ingredients. Here it goes. Look at this lovely thing. And my instructions, which are these beautiful steps, which I love. And again, I will share this recipe. It is so good. And so now I have this beautiful palenta and sausage stuffing recipe with instructions. formatting needs to get a little bit better. And I can take this and share this with friends. We can all share our favorite recipes with friends. We can all share what the ingredients are. So, if somebody has a dietary restriction, they can know exactly what it is. And my kid can follow the instructions directly. I do have to promote one thing, not a paid sponsor, but um my kid actually two years ago and I made this website, Runaway Pancakes. It is easy recipes for their kid and adult helper helpers. We basically productized this flow and we put a bunch of kidfriendly recipes up here, including his favorites. So, if you're looking for step-by-step, very kid-friendly recipes and instructions with pretty creepy but high quality midjourney generated images, no, we did not actually cook this salmon. Then you can go to runaway pancakes.com and uh we also have some great coloring pages. So, please let me know if you want me to add any of your favorite recipes to that site. So that was our very special pre-Thanksgiving how I AI episode on vibe coding your own personal party hub using lovable where I shared my personal tips and tricks for upleveling the design of your sites using things like free Google fonts and midjourney style references. We went through how you can add custom features that would never exist in an invite or party app directly to your app in Lovable. I showed how it's actually sometimes not perfect a debugging style issues. We'll go and fix these after afterwards and I'll publish the site. And then I shared my personal favorite way to translate recipes to make them easier to cook, especially when you're cooking for a big group. I am so thankful for all of our viewers and listeners. In case you missed it, we have just recently hit 50,000 subscribers on YouTube in just our first 6 months. This has been such a fun journey and I am looking forward to more holiday ending in AI how I AI episodes where I can share more tips and tricks like this for you. Thanks everyone.

    "description": "Tim McAleer is a producer at Ken Burns’s Florentine Films who is responsible for the technology and processes that power their documentary production. Rather than using AI to generate creative content, Tim has built custom AI-powered tools that automate the most tedious parts of documentary filmmaking: organizing and extracting metadata from tens of thousands of archival images, videos, and audio files. In this episode, Tim demonstrates how he’s transformed post-production workflows using AI to make vast archives of historical material actually usable and searchable.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. How Tim built an AI system that automatically extracts and embeds metadata into archival images and footage\n2. The custom iOS app he created that transforms chaotic archival research into structured, searchable data\n3. How AI-powered OCR is making previously illegible historical documents accessible\n4. Why Tim uses different AI models for different tasks (Claude for coding, OpenAI for images, Whisper for audio)\n5. How vector embeddings enable semantic search across massive documentary archives\n6.

    "transcript": "How did you think about what problems there were to solve in AI relative to your job and the people that you work with? And why did you start where you started? >> Post-production is like a technical mess of media management. You have many different file types. You have images, you have archival footage that you're gathering, live footage that you may have filmed out in the field, interviews, transcripts. So, it ends up being hundreds of hours of footage, tens of thousands of photos. The data management piece when you're dealing with all that different stuff is the mess that I have used AI to tackle. My goal was to automate this. For years, this has been manual data entry. >> Automate away toil. That's what you want to do. >> No one was going to make me this app. And so the ability to make an extremely specific app that makes a workflow and my team and my company easier. It's been an unbelievable moment. Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have Tim Mleier, a producer at Ken Burns Florentine Films who's responsible for the technology and processes that bring these amazing films to life. Instead of focusing on how AI can create creative for these films, we're actually going to talk about how Tim uses AI to build software products that make his post-p production and research team's lives a lot better. If you're working with images, video, sound, or just a lot of data, this episode is a great one for you. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. Rex is bringing that same power to finance. Rex is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi AI. Tim, welcome to How I AI. I'm excited to have you here. >> Thank you for having me. What I love about what we're going to talk about today is you work in a very interesting and creative industry putting out amazing content and we're going to talk a little bit about how AI is impacting the creation side of things, but you've actually used AI to smooth out some of the challenges you've had on the production and postp production side of things. So, I'm curious, how did you think about what problems there were to solve in AI relative to your job and the people that you work with? And why did you start where you started? >> Yeah. Uh, I think most of the flashiest use cases of AI in uh creation or media and entertainment right now are often in like generating full video content or images or whatever it is. But post-production specifically is like a technical mess of media management. Especially in non-fiction, you have like many different file types, right? And you have images, you have archival footage that you're gathering, live footage that you may have filmed out in the field, interviews, transcripts, and so like the data management piece when you're dealing with all that different stuff is the mess that I have used AI to tackle. And I think that the sort of like AI as a tool versus AI for generation is even more immediately applicable in our field at the moment. >> Well, and I have a very, you know, very simple, humble little podcast, but even for us, we create a lot of research and and longer content and we're editing it down. I'm just curious with documentaries and non-fiction work. What do you think the ratio is of media captured, researched, and archived to actually publish? Because that will maybe give us a sense of how much of this you have to grapple with to get a good good piece of content on the end. >> We have a thing in our industry called a shooting ratio. And so you can imagine in like a fiction series or, you know, like a sitcom on air. I don't quite know what those shooting ratios would be, but you're working with a script. And so you're gonna have a slightly lower ratio. In documentary, it can get quite high. Like I can tell you that we made a series about Muhammad Ali a few years ago. It was an 8-hour show. We gathered 20,000 still images in the database of just stills. I think it was over 100 hours of footage because he had a lot of fights and that kind of thing, news footage. And then we also filmed I want to say like 35 interviews for the piece. So it ends up being like hundreds of hours of footage, tens of thousands of photos. And that's just like that's one example of, you know, a particularly famous individual, but that tends to be what it looks like for our shows. >> So that's what you have to manage, make searchable, make usable by the entire production team. And you got inspired by chat GPT and some of these early AI tools to do some of that. So you want to hop in and show us what you know the first use case is? >> Absolutely. So, I'm going to start by kind of just showing you the like end result uh before I go right to like how I got here. So, on any film that we work on, we end up having some kind of database, right? So, this is a database where you can see the still images we've gathered. You you can see there's a footage section, a music section, anything that might go into the film, and all the kind of stuff you might expect to see, right? Descriptions, tags, a date on the thing, where we got it from. Um, some more technical detail is also going to appear over here. In any event, my goal was to automate this for years. This has been manual data entry. And so I remember vividly I'm going to jump into cursor now, but I do remember like when I first started doing this, it was chat GBT. I remember chat GBT added image upload and it was this insane day for us. I was like in the office with my colleague Clark and we were just like throwing images at it and seeing kind of the quality of the output. like it was this an aha moment where it was like, \"Oh my god, this thing can see and how could we harness this text generation, right, to to use it for our database entry.\" So, I'm going to simulate that like the starting point and then we'll jump to where we're at today. But essentially what it looked like at the beginning was we would throw something into GBT and we would say like, \"Hey, can you describe this?\" and it would hallucinate a little bit, but it was so tempting to figure out a way to harness that that I started essentially like writing little Python scripts with chat GPT. And at that time it was like VS Code on one monitor and GPT on another. And I'm going to All right, I'm just going to go ahead and demo what that kind of looked like. I'm going to speak my prompts if that's okay. I I use this tool called Super Whisper >> uh because it kind of cleans up my off-thecuff dictation. So, I have an image here of a nice street in somewhere America, maybe mid 20th century. We're going to see what kind of description we get from AI. All right. Uh, write me a script that submits the JPEG at the root of this workspace to OpenAI for description. I want just a general visual description of what we can see in the image. uh any API credentials you need are in a text file at the root of the folder. And what we can see here is that like everything I just said got funneled through uh this app called Super Whisper. So it got funneled through a prompt that itself is cleaning up my like messy vibe coding. I think it's clean enough. So we're going to go ahead and submit it. >> And I see you're using Claude 45 sonnet. Is that by choice or by default or >> that is because I'm on a podcast right now to be honest. It's like I think this is a very easy task for AI. I could keep it on auto for this, right? I will say I switch between various claw models depending upon the like difficulty and I do try and be cheap and stay on auto if I know that I'm asking for easy stuff, you know. >> Okay. So, you're just you're you're giving us a little bit of quality control here. >> Yeah. I don't want it to mess up. We're live on air, you know. >> Yeah. >> All right. So, it's telling me that I need to install some requirements. My guess is I have those requirements. It's got a submit image script. Let's see what it did. Here we go. It's running. Submitting this image to OpenAI for analysis. What kind of what kind of description will we get? There we go. This image depicts a small rural main street from what appears to be the mid- 20th century. We had guessed that. There are series of wooden storefronts each with signs indicating there are local businesses. Okay, so this is great. And this is kind of what we were getting in those early days of GPT image upload. But the problem here is like you're making a film, you want to know what rural main street, what town are we in, what is the exact year, and you can't really just go with this kind of generic description. So a lot of times we happen to know that images come with embedded metadata. And you know, if you're using your iPhone camera today, you know that maybe there's some metadata like GPS data, that kind of stuff. But archival images will often come with whatever notes people have scribbled onto them over time. And so I'm gonna now I'm gonna I'm gonna iterate on this one time and say I want you to add a step to this script. I want to scrape any available metadata from the file first and append that to the prompt. The goal here is that we are using any available metadata as like a source of truth for what this image actually is and not just guessing. And so just repeating that while this is running, what you're saying is, yeah, for this particular use case, you're working with a set of archival photos from sources that have embedded uh probably additional layers of metadata into it that you can read that give more information, which is different than, you know, scanning something or taking something off your off your phone, which I think we're going to look at a bit later. And so you're trying to harness the structured metadata off this file, >> which if you go back to the tab that shows the the image, we can't see with our with our human eyes, >> but our our agent friends can read with its robot brain. Um, and you're using that that information to then upgrade this script that is going to do all this AI analysis for you. >> That's exactly right. And so in this case it's going to be embedded metadata. I you know I happen to know this is a image from Library of Congress. There's going to be some metadata on it but it could also be something on the web like where this eventually goes to is like okay I know that there's a website with information may not be in the file but hey how about you go and scrape the web gather anything you can know about this because ultimately like this is a journalistic endeavor. We these shows get fact checked. We want everything going into our database to be, you know, true and verifiable information. All right. So, let's see how it did when it added that metadata check. So, it see it did a little bit of a scrape. It looks messy as hell, but somewhere in here we can see stuff like, yeah, archival information. And it's now going to use that. And what we've generally found is that when you add those guardrails, when you give it information, you know, to be true about the image, it it relies on that so much more than just what it can see. Like, you know, AI really wants to perform for us. It really wants to do a good job. And so when you give it the tools and the information to kind of write a better description, it's going to it's going to be able to get there. >> And I want to call out some things. So, we talked about using the anthropic claude models in particular for the actual coding of the script, but you're relying on the open AI models for the image analysis. Why open AI versus any other models that like stick with the one that you love or um it was the the first one that did a good job for you or do you feel like it's particularly good at image analysis? I'm curious why you select those different models for different use cases. >> Yeah, it's mostly that it's the first one. like they were the first one who had a they had a vision preview on their API. They did it before Claude and like I had built up enough of an infrastructure using that API call that it was like the switching costs were too much, you know. >> Yep. >> All right. So, let's see what we got this time. >> It's much more detailed. >> It is. It's much more detailed. So, the image shows a street scene on the main street of Cascade, Idaho. There we go. We know where it is now. Captured in 1941 by photographer Russell Lee. We've got photo credits. All right. So, this is a great example of like you add the guardrails and you're going to get more detail, but you're also just going to get facts, right? Before, I don't know if it's still up here somewhere. Yeah, before it was a small rural main street. Now, it is the main street of Cascade, Idaho. And so, we can imagine this getting duplicated in various ways, right? This image has embedded metadata. Maybe it's a website that we're going and gathering it from. But effectively, like this is where it all started. It started with a single Python script that I was running on my computer and I was like this is awesome. My database software is like it's advanced enough to call external scripts. You can kind of use any database to do this, you know, Air Table, whatever, but you just need something that has an API and that can call an external script or web hook or something. So, this is where we started. And now I'm going to switch my screen share to a remote machine like a little Mac Mini that I have running in my office. And what this, you know, it's hard to at this moment. It's a more complex cursor workspace. You can see um maybe I'll bop into the rules. Basically, what this is is a REST API so that every image file, video file, music file, anything that ends up in that database that we looked at at the beginning pings off of this REST API for all kinds of different like metadata tasks. If I if I pop into the jobs folder here for a second, you can we could zero in on like basically what we were just doing but the current iteration of it. So I call it auto log because the process of writing this in for years the the the manual data entry is called logging. So it's not the cleverest name but you know it fits. And you know you got a five-step process here. Basically first we're going to gather the info meaning like file specs you know how big the image is. Is it a JPEG? Is it a TIFF? We're gonna copy the file to our server. We're going to name it our ID number. We're going to parse it for metadata. Is there any metadata? If there is, great. But either way, we're going to look for more information on the web in this step four here. Scrape URL. And then once we know everything we could possibly know about that image, we're going to generate a description for it. And when you imagine how this might work for video, well, like video is itself, it's just 24 images in a second plus some audio. And so basically this just gets scaled up to deal with video files too. >> Are you using the same model for video files? Are you taking them extracting the stills and pushing them through open AI or using a different model? >> I use a different model for so I have to the the video files requires like two levels. Most video like AI models out there seem to do a basically some version of frame sampling. So, it could be extremely expensive if you were sending all 24 images every second to an API, right? So, I pull at 5-second intervals because I'm cheap. Some others maybe pull in a more in a smarter way, maybe at like lighting changes or something like that. Like there's different ways of thinking about the frame sampling. So, for the frame captions themselves, I will use a cheap model. I'll use like a nano GPT5 nano. But then for the and I can go in and show you a prompt here which maybe illustrates this. I have frame prompts which basically ask for just like a prompt of an individual still image extracted from video. But then I have a larger parent prompt. You can see that my prompts have gotten slightly more sophisticated over time. Um, basically what this does is it sends every single frame that we've extracted from a video file. It extends it anything like any of the audio we've transcribed from that video file. It packages it up into this elaborate prompt and it sends it to a reasoning model. >> And the purpose of that is to say like these are all the video events that we have observed in this video. Here is like a massive text file of data. Tell me what you think is happening in the video. >> Got it. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I you know maybe maybe tip from one of our how other how AI guests, but I found that the Gemini um the Gemini models are quite good with video. It's actually what we use to do our podcast raw recording to uh both highlight stills and a blog post that I put out. I process them through the the Gemini models and have had a lot of success. >> And it just pulls out like the stills that might be >> it automatically pulls interesting stills. It actually gives me interesting stills plus 5 seconds or like plus 5 seconds plus minus 5 or minus 5 seconds because sometimes the guest and I are looking ridiculous some. >> Yeah. Yeah. Of course. base. So tip to anybody out there with video who hasn't tried the Gemini models, I I find those particularly good for this use case. >> You might have just, you know, added something to our little road map here. >> Well, um, and so and then I'm curious about the audio side of things. So I kind of, you know, I' I play with the Gemini models for video. This still makes tons of sense to me. Tell us a little bit about the audio side of things. >> So the audio is also I now I feel like I'm an OpenAI shill. Everything I'm using is OpenAI and I think except for the coding which is interesting but I think it's just habit. I use Whisper for audio. So like Whisper's an incredible open-source model for speechtoext detection. Even the like mediumsiz model does a pretty good job. And what I do is and I can pop back into the database software maybe to like illustrate this. What I do is I extract, you can see like frames pulled every five seconds >> and there's a caption associated with each frame and then there's this is a shot of an alligator in a swamp. So he doesn't have any audio. He wasn't talking. But I basically pull audio at 5-second increments so that when we send those like video events up to the reasoning model, we are sending a full transcript, but we're sending it like kind of like pegged to the moment in the video that it happened. If that makes sense. Yep. So, the transcription is all happening, you know, on my back end over here. Um, everything like I think I could probably open up the console and see like there we go. Like someone just sent a a job through not that long ago. Like I can kind of come in here and see what my colleagues are doing as they ping my API all day long. >> Great. And so you're pairing a snapshot image every 5 seconds from a video, the 5-second transcript of the audio speech to text via whisper >> metadata if you have it, parsing that all together, and then getting a very robust description and analysis of the content that you have available in back in this tool that you're using to archive, log, manage all all your assets. >> Yeah. And like I said, that tool could be kind of agnostic. Like you could do it in a Google sheet if that's, you know, if that's what you like. But um I like this. We've been using it for a while. Everything we just talked about is how we kind of get to like metadata that we can read, right? Like generative metadata that is a we know it's accurate because it's kind of been put on these guard rails by our metadata extraction steps. And then also it it provides this like nice visual for us. We can see what this thing is at a glance. But the next step of this now that you have this like API running in the background is you can generate something that maybe I can't read but the AI can read pretty well which is vector embeddings. So I'll jump back to stills for this because I think it's a maybe an easier illustration of it. Every asset in our database gets put through two modes of embedding. So we'll send the thumbnail through and run it against an open- source model. I use clip for this and I'll generate an embedding off of that and then we'll send the description through um I use again an open AI text model for this um and get an embedding for that and then we'll fuse them and the purposes of that is that so now we have like the ability to discover things semantically like prior to this and I think in a lot of film production today you're working with exact text search you know like if that description says dog but you know somebody wrote in puppy you're not finding that image. And so this has been like kind of the most exciting part of it. Not necessarily where I knew it was going when it started. Like I was just excited to generate a description, right? But now the ability to discover semantically is I think you know the most the most uh robust part of the system. >> So what I love about this I mean a a couple things is one you've really pushed every step of the way. You know, you could have stopped at like we got good descriptions or we got like the structured metadata out and now I have a script that runs it. You could have stopped at images only, but you took it to video and video and audio. You could have stopped at structured data only, but you went to embeddings to get semantic search. So, I love just the breadth of applicability of the AI in this process. But what I probably love more is I doubt this was anybody's favorite part of their job. Like I doubt it was anybody's favorite part of their job to be like I'm going to go read some Library of Congress meditate. >> It used to be my job. So I can tell you firsthand not my favorite part. And it's also like I think the the best argument I have for all the work I've done creating this system is that like the same people who used to write this data were the ones who are responsible for doing the research. So you've now freed them up to just look more, right? Like maybe now we could gather 25,000 still images for the Muhammad Ali project because you have that much more time. You're not just like copy and pasting stuff off a website to put it in this form, you know? >> Well, and you probably get to select from this big archive of data better assets to use in your content because they're more discoverable because you have more confidence in the source and the content of of that data. So, I bet it up levels at the end of the day the quality at at the end >> um because you have just much more data to work off of >> 100%. I mean, like a real quick example of that, too, is like I'm going to use a link in here, which is maybe not the best use use of this image, but embeddings enable us to find things in ways we never would have thought to find them before. So, like I have a button down here or when I click it, what it basically is going to do is a reverse image search within our own collection. So, if I if I'm an editor and I like an image, and this is going to take a while because I'm not on site, but if I like an image, I can click the find similar button, and it's just going to go and find every image that kind of has that vibe. >> You can see here we have a duplicate of this one, but then there you go. It recognized the man and it started pulling in other portraits. >> This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. Brex is bringing that same power to finance. Brex is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/h how I AI. I love this. Okay. So, this is more of your archival and footage data, but you capture a lot of stuff in the field where people are not sitting in front of cursor or their desktop um looking through these assets. And I know that you use some vibe coding and a creative approach to get more information about those assets. Could you walk us through that? >> Yeah, so the next use case is an app that I developed for archival research in the field. So I think that we we really pride ourselves on like turning over every rock on on not just relying on what's digitized and available online and going and visiting physical archives. And so um the process of visiting a physical archive is basically you have a bunch of folders um that you pull ahead of time. You arrive there and your goal is just to snap like low resolution iPhone snaps of everything you can possibly get. And so you're snapping the front of the image and you're snapping the back of the image because the back is typically where there's going to be like a scrolled description or maybe like uh an accession number and ID number that the archive has added themselves. And so this process used to look like you show up at the archive, you take iPhone snaps for two days, you get back to the office, you have the messiest camera roll you've ever had, you cannot actually pair your fronts to your backs because it just got out somehow it got out of order along the way. And so the goal was basically to make that process like a little better. So I I vibe coded this iOS app to deal with this problem. And I I tend to just like speak in screens like the way maybe it's because I'm a visual person. Like the way I deal with it is I just think like okay I see a screen that does this and a screen that does this. I I imagine a button that does this. And the purpose of this was basically like I want people to be able to create collections for each folder they're capturing. I want them to be able to snap a front and a back um like a the the flip side of the image uh so that they can easily associate those so the file names associate them and I want to immediately transcribe any information on the back and embed it into the original image. So now I have this app called flip-flop. I ask chat GBT at the end of my dog walk to generate some kind of specs doc or requirement doc. It pretty much does it in one go. If you chat with it for 30 minutes, you know, you can get a lot done. Uh, and then I fed this PRD to clawed code and it this one it like it it didn't build it in one shot, but it certainly built the UI in one shot. And so I guess maybe we should just jump into like the actual app. >> Yeah, let's do it. >> So flip-flop, which is my cute little name for it, is uh basically designed to capture those fronts and backs that I was talking about. So you have three screens here. You've got a collection screen where you're going to create your folders. You've got a capture screen where you're going to take your images. And I'll just quickly highlight this part, which is where you kind of have your AI processing options. So, I allow people to define a separate prompt for what I call the flip side of the image, the front, and the flop side of the image, the back. And so, in this example, I'm going to show you some photos of my dog now. And uh the flop side of the image is going to have some text on it. So, our prompts here are really just designed to get a decent caption from the image and to transcribe any text that we see on the back end. So, let's create a new collection. We're going to call it how I A I that that's good enough. There's also an option here to add more context. You know, the AI loves context. And so maybe if you're, you know, you can imagine if you're digitizing an entire collection of, you know, someone's personal letters or someone's uh portrait photographs, you would add that kind of thing here. But for now, we're just going to create a collection. Tap into that collection and capture. So here we go. >> It's a screen share within a screen share. >> We're going to not care about the glare too much. I'm going to capture the front side of this image of my dog Tony's third birthday. I now have the option to add notes if that's what I want to do. Or I could just add a flop side of the image right here. And when I complete that, it will have because it's lightning fast already sent it up to OpenAI for a description and embedded it. And this is the really crucial thing because you just saw the first system I had embedded it in the image metadata itself. So the flop details have the transcription Tony's third birthday and all of that will show up in the what we call XIF metadata which is just the image metadata standard. >> Got it. And just for people that that may be passed by instead of simply generating kind of the text description and storing that in a database relative to the original image you took, you actually now have this structured metadata on the image file itself, which again like what a pain. >> Oh, a giant a giant pain. Yeah, it's >> a bane to do manually. And so now anytime anybody uses one of these images, even if they don't have um access to this this app even now that that that image is embedded with that metadata >> 100%. So you could pull this onto any computer or any app, anything that can read underlying metadata and it's going to be able to see that this was Tony's third birthday. And so that's structured metadata in the sense that we've now structured the actual information about the image. But the other thing that's really crucial honestly is that we've structured the files themselves, right? So you can see they're getting named in a particular way. And so we've moved from like camera roll mess to like files that are going to sort in your in your computer that you're going to be able to import cleanly. You're going to be able to distinguish easily what's the front of the image, what's the back of the image. And that has, I think, been the other unlock. Like I had two colleagues out in the field a couple weeks ago and they came back with 1,400 images. And I don't think that's only because they were able to use Flip-Slop to capture it, but I think FlipFlop is certainly making the process easier since they've gotten back. The the thing that I want to call out for folks, maybe a general takeaway here is these AI models are so good with files and code can do a lot of stuff with files and a lot of the people we talk to um you know markdown is the file type dour these days which is you know just like a a specially formatted text document. But if you start to look at other file types and really understand what can be put in a particular file type, you can actually discover some pretty interesting things you can do with a combination of AI and coding to make those files much more useful for your use case. So, this is one of these takeaways where I'm like, I haven't thought about like what can be embedded in an image file or what can be embedded in a video file. And even just having, you know, Chad GBT or one of your general models say, \"Hey, I'm working with an image. How can I load it up with as much context and specificity as possible? What's available to me?\" And then using that as a jumping off point for what you do is a pretty interesting use case of AI. I didn't even know like I'm very familiar with stills underlying metadata fields but I didn't really know what was available in audio or what was available in in in video files and I just sort of I go into cursor and I ask right like now we have a music workflow which we're not going to look at but like where we embed artist album kind of like licensing data into any music we consider for a film and I didn't know that there was an metadata field we could just store that in but of course there is you know somebody thought of this a long time ago. >> Yep. Amazing. Okay, we have one last use case, which um mom, if you're listening, I think you're going to like this one. My mom's a genealogologist. >> So, uh I think she's going to like this this use case, but let's show it first and then I'll call out mama where I think you can use it. >> Okay. All right. So, you can imagine in our films, we work with a lot of documents and we're not always interested in the entire document. Sometimes like we just want to transcribe maybe part of it. Maybe um we want to translate and transcribe part of it. Like take this newspaper document for instance. Like maybe the Arkansas State News is the article we're interested in. That's the transcript we want to be searchable. That's what our editor might want to consider for the film. We can't just like put this in Adobe Acrobat and OCR the whole thing. It's like it's not going to work. And even more than that, like the quality of the image would not work with most OCR engines, you know. So AI is really good at OCR of old documents. It's really good at handwriting. It's pretty good at translation, too. So I built, and we're not going to get into the building necessarily, but this is this is one of the few like Xcode builds I had to do. So this is a Swift build, a little Mac menu bar app. It's called OCR party. Uh, which stems from the fact that we're just OCRing part of the image. You got to have fun with these things. And let's see. We're going to open up that newspaper in OCR party. We're going to get like a little preview window. So, let's say actually what we want is Coolage seeks peace in the world. So, let's zoom in a little bit. Let's open up our cropping tool. This little thing down here is basically a choice between Mac OS vision and uh an AI API call. And the purpose of that is because sometimes people don't sometimes people don't trust AI. You might have heard. And so I I built that in as an option essentially. I would I would think the AI option gets used more. But nevertheless, now you're going to select just the part of this article you care about or this paper that you care about. And you can see there's like a crease in the paper. There's a weird black mark here, but you can imagine we submit this for OCR. Now, we have just that text that we pulled. We're also calling out for our editors like where on the page they're going to be able to find it if they want to sort of zoom in on it, crop to that particular article. And I can't exactly remember what text we were looking at, but it certainly completed those sentences where there was a black marker. Right? So AI was able to kind of infer to the best of our ability what that sentence might have said. And you know if this ends up in a film, I could guarantee it would get fact checked later. But for the purposes of gathering documents, thousands of documents, this ability to kind of like precisely OCR is is has been a nice little unlock for us. >> One thing I also want to make sure people take away from this episode is we've seen basically three form factors of apps. So yes, they've all used AI, >> but you've been able to swap between sort of like a Python API service that gets called by another software application or database, a um iOS app that you know you can run on your phone and then like a little desktop toolbar widget. And what I like what I love about this moment in AI with with regards to software engineering is like if you have basic software engineering practices and then you know enough to be dangerous like yeah you can you can vibe code uh and you know a swift swift app to run on on your local desk. hyper specific app, you know, like no one was going to make me this app. And so the ability to make like an extremely specific app that makes a workflow, you know, on my team and my company easier, it's been it's been an unbelievable moment. >> Yeah. I I would say the TAM for this app is like you. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I could sell it to like two colleagues. Well, and then my mom, so what I was going to tell you is my mom um is a genealogologist for uh the Daughters of the American Revolution, of which I am one. Uh fun fact on Claire. >> Oh, no way. >> And she does the lineage tracing. And do you know how many times she screenshots something and is like, can you read this cursive? Like what in the world >> is this name? And it's like, you know, one name and a big a big image. And so I do think AI's and I'm like yeah I'm going to drop this into chat GPT and I'll tell you what I think it says and I think it's ability to read handwriting um old type faces kind of understand the nuances of of spelling and things like that are just really really interesting for these sort of um research use cases. Yeah, we didn't look at a handwritten doc here, but that is definitely something happening uh at our company like the ability to read letters that we could not read before and also just other languages, right? And then we immediately have that text to you have letters written in some kind of cursive scroll from the 17th century that is now translated to English and made legible for you. >> Amazing. Well, we've seen three great use cases. I am sure you are the hero on the team for this kind of stuff because I can imagine again >> people might be tired of hearing me talk about AI but thank you. >> Yeah but I mean this is this is hard stuff. It's tedious work to do. It, you know, requires a lot of time, a lot of detail orientation, and I'm sure people love using this information to produce amazing things, but probably is not their favorite thing, like zooming in and squinting at the um at the text to try to get try to get it the most accurate as possible. >> Try trying to, you know, automate away painful processes, right? Not the things people liked. >> Automate away toil. That's what we want to Yes. >> That's what we want to do. Okay. Well, we're going to do a couple lightning round questions. I'm going to get you out of here um to you know go digitize a thousand more images. >> So the first thing I want to ask you about is just your approach to learning. It seems like from what I'm seeing you're pretty fearless about new technologies, new things. I think this moment is such a critical moment for upskilling and learning. How do you think about learning in this moment? I think that uh one of the reasons that I find like tools like cursor or claude code kind of intuitive is to me there's a parallel with creative software. So like at various moments in my career I have been deep in Photoshop or deep in Adobe Premiere or Avid Media Composer whatever it is and those softwares are so complex. They are like a maze of tool menus and you end up on Reddit and on YouTube doing your research trying to just like figure out how to accomplish the thing. And I think that that's essentially what a lot of these tools are today too. Like I've been on cursor YouTube and cursor Reddit and learned tips and tricks on like from the vibe coding people of the internet. And uh you know I think it sort of starts from knowing what could be done or what's possible and the like path to get there is is swifter than ever before. >> What I like about this I started sort of my fascination with technology in these creative tools. I will like is this is like preoshop where I would go and how can I make my text look like liquid golden I would follow these like fivestep you know um graphics uh tools tutorials and what I love about this moment in vibe coding or AI assisted engineering is coding feels such so much more creative than technical where these tools feel really like creation engines to me more than functional tools to write write code. And so I love that parallel because it's what's made me so excited about technology my entire career. And I think it's why I'm so leaned in this moment. It like activates that same feeling of like, oh, now I can do can make this thing that I didn't think I could make before. >> I think that there are a lot of people too in my industry who have a kind of creative brain and creative approach to these things that would, you know, maybe like looking at a cursor window right now when you have no idea what it is is a little scary. But I actually think that they are more well suited for the work than they might know. >> Well, let's talk a little bit about your industry because I know that the film and creative world is deeply skeptical of AI. Um, sometimes we we we we wait into the the waters of AI video generation on this podcast and get a little feedback and I totally understand. I have family that's in the creative industry. I'm curious, you know, what's your point of view of AI particularly in the film world. What are you excited about and where do you think these kind of concerns are really warranted? And then where do you think the most practical applications are? >> I think today it's like sort of where we started at the top. The practical applications are more in like tooling than they are in creation. But I do think that like the creation's going to get there. Like today I play with I play with all the generative video models. Like how can I not? They're they're super fun. Um they are not like at professional grade quality yet. Like the amount of time you spend throwing tokens at even the highest end video models, you're not going to be able to match your shots that well. You're not going to be able to match the footage you shot yourself that well. And so I don't think they're there yet, but let's like I'll be honest, they're going to get there. I think that like they are still exciting to me, but I would separate a couple things. Like in the non-fiction world, I think I think people should be careful. Like I think >> we should not be generating archival footage. we should not be trying to fool our viewers into thinking that there was video in 1750, you know, and I think that that's the part that's like a little scary. And then of course there's the dis like job displacement aspect of things. I think people are scared if you film stuff for a living, you're definitely scared that like that >> you're going to be able to just like use text to generate that same video you used to shoot. So I don't know how to like I don't think anybody has like good answers to that part of it. >> But my approach has certainly just been like jump in and learn the tools like they are >> they are going to be here whether we want them to be or not. And uh >> I think that they have a lot of practical benefits today that are less scary. >> Yeah. The best advice I can give to people and I have I have of all the spaces and I'll say this honestly of all the spaces I have the most job displacement concern it's in video generation for >> non um non-archchival non-doccumentary cases but commercial use cases um you just you just see how it could be very applicable and >> the best advice that I can give to people in this moment is the more you learn the tools the better off you will be whether or not you know whether or not you love where the tools are taking us as an industry or as a culture knowledge is power and so the more you learn and understand one you can identify opportunities where it does add value even in your creative process and two you're going to be differentiated in the market from a job perspective because you're going to have a more robust sense of what's available in your industry and I think that stands for people in your industry I think it stands for people in my industry and technology so I just There is no harm in learning this stuff. >> Yeah, absolutely. I also think that like there's a place in the process for it, which allows you like a place to learn without thinking it needs to end up in the final product, right? Like you can use video models for storyboarding all day. You can maybe prove whether or not that shoot is worth spending that money on. Now, you've learned how to use the video models a little bit and you know, you haven't necessarily displaced anyone, but you've like made your production a little bit more efficient, a little smarter. Maybe you've shot better footage as a result of it, you know. >> Yes. But we're not we're not generating fake archival footage of like gay. >> We're not we are not doing that. Uh definitely not doing that. And I'm like PBS, which is where most of our films end up, have a lot of guidelines around that. And I think that's a good thing. But it's the other stuff. It's commercial. It's visual effects. Like a lot of that stuff's going to get easier. Um and so it's it's coming one way or another. >> Great. Well, last question have to ask you. when you know you're on your dog walk with ChatGBT doing voice mode and it's not listening to you or not giving you what you want. What is your personal prompting technique? Especially because you use voice. Like I'm willing to type things to AI. I don't know if I'd be willing to say them. So what's what's your technique here? >> It definitely is different when you have to say it out loud. Um I am I am super nice to the AI. I like can vividly remember the one time I was mean to it. I'm nice to the I don't know where this is going. I'm going to be nice to all the models. What I do is like for lack of a better way of describing it, I just start over. Like I will I know that a lot of these things have ways of like consolidating the context window now and sort of summarizing, but I will ask for what I call like a resume work prompt. I'll be like, \"This isn't working. I want to resume work later with another AI dev. Can you give me a prompt with everything they'll need to know?\" And typically what you'll find is that that prompt shows you where it was off, you know, like in its summarization of what it was doing, I'll be like, \"Oh, see like I wasn't asking for that. That's that's why we were not communicating.\" And then I'll take that resume work prompt. I'll prune it a little bit, pop it into another chat, and then, you know, you'll find that you wish you hadn't beat your head against the wall with the previous chat for 20 minutes. >> You know, I am also team be polite to your AI, but then again, like, you hurt the one you love the most. And I' I've found myself occasionally getting testy. And you know when I stopped being mean to AI is when reasoning really started to show and I could see it reasoning how upset I was. It was >> Oh, it'll be like the user is mad at me right now. >> The user is really frustrated with me right now. I need to totally rethink my go sweet baby AI. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm not that mad at you. >> Okay. So create a, you know, go return to progress prompt. Really get the summary. take that to understand if there was some misunderstanding, improve that and then just start fresh. That's great. Well, Tim, this has been super fun. So much for me to learn. I have tons of ideas even just for my day-to-day life about how I can use I have kids, so I probably have 30,000. >> Let me know if your mom wants the OCR party. >> I will. She'll love it. Okay, Mom. I have gotten you your first Vibecoded app direct from the podcast source. Tim, where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Yeah. Uh I'm not that active on social to be honest, but I am on LinkedIn. You can find me on there. I have a website that is itself a fun vibe code project. So you can find me at timmacle.com. I have a little chatbot there, the GP Tim. You can go chat with him, learn a little bit more more about me and my work. Uh and then other than that, I would say tune in to Florentine Film's upcoming production. We have a a series about the American Revolution coming out in November. So on your local PBS station. My kids are obsessed with the American Revolution. So, everybody >> sounds like it's in the family. >> Yeah, we will. We will be uh big fans. Tim, this has been great.

    "transcript": "With my company, my sales team was consistently telling me that they just didn't know how to find anything. They didn't know how to find what customers were interested in. >> You had a bunch of salespeople. They said, \"I need more information to serve our customers better.\" You realized you had 25,000 hours or something of recorded customer calls, which are the perfect source of truth for how customers want to be interacted with. You're going to show us a zap now that takes a single recording and does a bunch of stuff. So basically I needed to figure out well can I create a feed for Zapier. So it knew the call ID of each new call has occurred. So the first step is essentially a trigger where a new call comes in. It'll basically scrape the information from Gong and one of the things Gong will give you is that call ID. So that append it to the URL essentially is all I needed to give browse to be able to go to that URL and able to essentially scrape the entire transcript. It wasn't connected. I had to kind of hack it together. >> I love a CEO that knows how to build it. I love a CEO who knows that no problem is not solvable. [music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claravel, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have Matt Britain, CEO of Suzie. Now, normally we show two or three workflows, but today Matt's going to show off the one mega workflow that rules it all at his company. He's going to show you how to take a single asset and turn it into tons of go to market goodness. [music] From emails to customers, enrich data sources, and even marketing assets that can be used to source more prospects that are going to be successful with your product. [music] Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. If you're listening to this show, you already [music] know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. Brex is bringing that same [music] power to finance. Brex is the intelligent finance platform built [music] for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance [music] stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account, and you've got a system that helps [music] you spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in the US already runs on Brex. You can too at bre.com/howi ai. Matt, thanks for coming on how I AI. I'm excited because as I was saying before we started the show, we get vibe coders left and right and I know we're going to talk about some custom software that you built, but we just do not get enough on the go to market and marketing side of AI automation. So, I'm really excited to show what you have to share. So, really appreciate you joining today. >> I'm excited to be here. So, you and I both really love Zapier, and I have to ask, even before the age of AI, was this a tool that you relied on? Why has that this specific software become kind of the backbone of so many of your AI based automations? >> So, I've always been fairly technical, but I've never been a coder. Um, I sold the first ads ever on Facebook directly to Mark Zuckerberg and Edward Sver in 2005. Um, I bought some of the first Google keywords ever to exist, right, when I started my business, um, in 2002, my first ad agency. Um, so I've always loved sort of ad tech and getting like understand how these tools work, but at the same time, I've never been an engineer. And as I've wanted to get more sophisticated in the in the tools and solutions I've built for various companies that I've run, I've need to not just use one tool like Adwords, but multiple tools to stitch things together to be more efficient. And I was turned on to Zapiero like most other people just through a Google search. And I think I wanted to connect um you know leads that were coming in through my website to some type of flow where it automatically emailed the person who signed up. And then I just kind of start to dive into it. But to your point, Claire, it wasn't until Zapier integrated AI when kind of my mind just became blown in terms of what's possible. >> Okay. So, you're going to show us how you take a single asset, and I won't spoil what it is, and turn it into basically a full suite of activities across your marketing, sales, internal, company work. So, why don't you pull that up and show us what you built? >> Before I pull it up, I guess you should say that I think it's all about figuring out what problem that you want to solve. And I think with AI in general, people get so overwhelmed with just the amount of tools and the rate of change that they just find themselves kind of playing around with all these tools trying to get to the point where they feel like they're comfortable in understanding them, but at the same time they're not really moving their business forward. And I think the reason that's the case is people [snorts] don't ever take a step back and think like what is the core problem I need to solve for my business? Like what's holding me back from growing faster than I want to? what what's getting in my way or what's an opportunity I know is there but you know I'm not I'm not able to take advantage of it. And with my company, what I was hearing over and over again was my sales team was consistently telling me that they just didn't know how to find anything. They didn't know how to find what customers were interested in. they didn't know how to find um how to speak to people of a certain industry or a certain title in terms of identifying use cases. So there just so many unknowns and so once I understood and put my finger on that on that problem, I just became very sort of tunnel visioned and I was determined to figure out how I can build solutions that can aid my sales and customer success team to be more in the no. So once you've actually identified the problem, the next step is figuring out what data can help you seize that opportunity. And in the case of you know understanding our customers and and and getting that information, it just so happens that since the pandemic when our company went remote, we've been using this tool called Gong that's essentially attached to Zoom calls that records every single call that we have. So it says this call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes. And I always knew we had obviously Zoom and I knew that we had Gong, but what I didn't know is that their transcripts were amazing and that we actually had 25,000 hours of call transcripts that had been a mess over the last 5 years. And if you think about understanding information about your customers and your business, there's no better source of truth. So we have since built an entire operating system around this information. Not just the historical information, but a variety of different workflows that happen with each new call that occurs because it's not just about understanding what's happened in the past, but it's also being able to be highly responsive to what's going on in the present. So the first thing I'm going to show today is an automation that we have created based upon calls our our teams have either our sales team or our customer success team. Um, so and essentially what happens is as soon as that call is over, a series of events happen with that individual transcript. We also do things sort of at large with the aggregate transcripts, if that makes sense. But right now, I'm going to show you what happens kind of like real time once a call is completed. >> Great. So, while you pull that up, just to recap for our listeners, you had a bunch of salespeople. They said, \"I don't know how to find the information that I need. I don't know how to generate the information I need. I need more information to serve our customers better. >> You realized you had, and I'm correct me if I'm wrong, 25,000 hours or something of corrected >> customer calls, which are the perfect source of truth for >> how customers want to be interacted with. >> And you decided that was going to be the core context for a lot of these actions inside your company. And then you're going to show us a zap now that takes a single recording and does a bunch of stuff. I got a preview of this and it does a lot of things. >> I've I tried to give AI to my engineering team to figure stuff like this out and it just became overwhelming to them even integrating the product and what's been helpful for me was first building things on my own and I'm not technical enough to be able to build on top of our software product. So the tools like the one I'm going to show you today was a great way for me to be able to dive into the power of AI because it was on the edges of the it wasn't the product was sort of on the edges of how we operate it and through that though I became far more adept at AI and now I'm very much involved in our product itself. So often people struggle to find a way in and there's lots of different ways in. One way is actually building something for yourself personally or building something for the marketing organization or somewhere else and then through that process you really start to get it and then you can start to be more um you know proficient in AI in much more substantive ways within the business. >> Yeah. And I want all the other CEOs and executives watching this podcast to listen to exactly what you said because it is not sufficient to instruct your engineers to build AI. >> You'll go nowhere. Yep. >> No, you'll go nowhere. And I've said this a lot. This is a moment for actual hard skill building um in leaders, which is you actually have accessible skills to build in using AI, building AI tools, using these sort of like no code versions of tools to really upskill yourself on the capability. And that's going to make you a much more relevant leader, much more. >> Yeah. You're opening up the hood. It's like you think about if you bring your car in and you don't know anything about fixing a car and they tell you $4,000 to fix a transmission, you're gonna say, \"Okay, because you need your transmission fixed, right?\" But if you actually just open up the hood and you understand how transm transmission works, even if you're not a mechanic, >> maybe you can say, \"Well, it really shouldn't cost $4,000 to fix this. Should really cost close to 2,000.\" And I think that's sort of the same analogy when it comes to AI. So um so I so the the the first step is building what I call a trigger automation and this trigger automation essentially comes from a tool uh that we've created called um that we use called browse AI. So this is browse AI and essentially a browse AI does is it runs like a a script where essentially scrapes information from gone calls. So what you see here is a URL string. You need a URL string in order to identify a a call transcript as it comes in. And Gong didn't have an easy way to do this. So I basically start to bring up a bunch of uh call transcripts. And what I start to see is they all kind of start the same way and they just end it with this call ID. So the only thing different from call to call was this call ID. So basically I needed to figure out how can I create a feed for Zapier. So it knew the call ID of each new call as as it kind of occurred. So the first step is essentially a trigger where a new call comes in right and then what happens is when the new call comes in what it will do is it'll basically scrape the information from Gong. And one of the things Gung will give you is that call ID. So I'm able to actually see the call ID. So if I click here um and I scroll over, you'll actually see that there's a call ID that I can identify here um which is right here. And so that appended to the URL essentially is all I needed to give browse to be able to go to that URL and essentially scrape the call transcript. So it it wasn't connected. I had to kind of hack it together. So if you'll see here, it basically knows what to run just based upon what's brought in and then it will go to this page which which I will show you here which actually is where the transcript is and it's able to essentially scrape the entire transcript. So this is the raw transcript that's coming from the gong calls by browse AI going to that gong page and just getting this information. But I had that initiated. So that first step essentially initiates the scrape and then when the scrape is completed, it starts my next automation. >> Yeah. And so just to call this out for folks that are trying to build their own thing, it's okay if your tool itself does not expose the data you want. In this age now, you can usually use another tool or an alternative. >> There's always a way >> or an LLM to really pull the data you need out of out of any system. >> Yeah. And I could have given up Claire like at that point at that probably one step took me the longest. And if I never would have gotten past that step I and I think a lot of people would probably have given up at that step. But after I got over that hurdle then everything else became so much easier. And it's really like an analogy for life like building something like this. And there are other stumbles I've had along the way in building things. But you just have to know that there's a way and and using and because just because a tool doesn't do it doesn't mean it can't be done. And this like in in the rearview mirror seems obvious. And now if I had a similar challenge, I'd be able to do it right away because what will happen is every time you solve a problem such as that, the next time you need to build something, you'll have all these sort of ideas and like hacks um in your tool chest, so to speak. And then now I'm at a point where there's like nothing you can tell me to build that I wouldn't know how to build because I just know how all these little things can be solved for. And you learn coding along the way. Like along the way, you learn what JSON means and all these things by having your hands on it and and and creating the automations. >> 100%. What I was going to say is this is a CEO that I love. I love a CEO that knows how to build it. I love a CEO who knows that like no problem is not solvable. Um, and I think just even getting hands- on with some of these no code tools and these AI tools just gives you a little bit more context to be bolder about what you build. Okay, so you have >> That's right. So the task is done, right? The the call is done. And so this next trigger is trigger when browse AI successfully scrapes a call transcript. And the first thing it'll do is obviously it'll trigger it. And you'll see here it'll give me the entire transcript of the call. Um, and that's basically now now it's like, okay, now I'm in business. Right now I have everything I need. And there's a bunch of other stuff in that gun call transcript that I use to do database lookups throughout that we'll kind of get into. I I'll have a delay of about 2 minutes before pulling in data like this just because I want to make sure that all the data is brought in, the scrape is done, and I'm just you you're prone to errors, especially if you're running a lot of um tasks quickly if you don't put in a delay. So, I always like a one or two minute delay as a buffer just to let the system catch up so it doesn't break. So, so that that's kind of self-explanatory. The next thing I do is I run a format where I'm basically removing all the HTML from the transcript. So, when you scrape sometimes it'll pull in the HTML and I don't want that. I just actually want the actual text. So, I run a formatter step where I'm removing all that. Um, I'm pulling out anything I need to that might confuse uh the analysis. So, I'm just essentially getting the raw text. Then what I do is I start to enrich the data with other information besides just the gong transcript because I had the gong transcript, but one of the things I knew I wanted to build was after the call is done, I wanted to be able to tell the salesperson that was on that call what transpired. I wanted to make it easy for them to write a follow-up email. I want to be able to identify who their supervisor was, right? But that wasn't directly pulled in through through Gong. However, we have other data sources that essentially can connect that information. So, we have a Google sheet here. For example, if you look up this ID, it connects the ID to the brand and the brand to the user, which is a whole separate workflow that we created. So, it can kind of connect the dots because when you're running an automation, you're not always going to get the data from the trigger. Sometimes you have to round it out. And the way you round it out is using things like lookups on Google Sheets. So, you're pulling everything in. It's almost like you're going down a path, you're on a hiking trail, and you want to be able to pull the supplies you need along the way before you get to the destination. And [clears throat] when I started, I had a backpack, but the backpack didn't have water in it. And now I have water, right? Cuz I grabbed it from here. And you're kind of going along a journey. And I personally one reason why I love Zapier versus other tools is the way my mind thinks is in a very sequential framework where there's other platforms like NA and you know or bot press where it's basically like looks like you almost like an octopus how it's branching out. I just have a hard time thinking that way. Now over time I've had to because I'm basically describing the difference between automation and agents cuz agents are not deterministic. Agents have different ways and my brain has struggled with understanding agents and I'm finally getting there. But basically the progression I see people having to take in AI is you start with using AI as a tool. You know chat GBT give me a recipe for lasagna. Then it's okay automations which we're talking about now and then you get into the world of agents where it's not just always going from step one to two to three. It might go from step one to three to eight based upon what you're trying to accomplish. Well, one tip for you or one tip for the listeners here I found is we'll go through this whole thing and a good exercise I found is taking a sequential stepbased automation and trying to use for example Zapier agents and just describe that automation in natural language in steps >> and see how close you can get even that replication across modalities can be a good way to to test your exercise. >> Yeah. Just test it out 100%. Yeah. and it's looking up the information. So, it's able to basically grab the information. And then after I feel like I've had all the information, the next thing I'm going to do is this where I'm starting to pull in the LLM. And an important part here is first and foremost knowing what LLM to use. And one thing I've had a hard time with is actually just we have so many automations now. And I think we can do a better job at the organizational design behind it because what happens I built so many things and I don't always do proper handoffs. So, for example, here I it should always say use latest stable version, but it didn't, right? So, so I'm going to change it now here live on the spot because I want to be using the latest version. You also want to make sure you're using the best model. I still think GBT4 Turbo is probably a good model for this, but you could see in the platform like Zapier, there are multiple different versions that you can choose from based upon and obviously they all eat up different amounts of coins and um but it's pretty incredible in terms of all the models. Now with GPT5, it's supposed to be able to choose for you, but it's unclear to me how that works in the context of an API. And for some reason, still in Zapier, you're still able to choose. And you know, I I spend a lot of time testing. I'll go in the chat GPT and test a sample input in a variety of different models to make sure. It's like whatever's the best output the quickest is what I'll tend to use. >> So, you're still losing classic GPT4 Turbo, a good old classic classic favorite, >> right? >> AI is supposed to make work easier, but I've been there. Weeks of setup, endless back and forth with engineering, and yet another tool the team never really adopts. That's why I use Zapier's AI orchestration platform. It connects with nearly 8,000 apps, so I can finally put AI to work without the drama, without the delays, and without [music] pulling engineering in every time I want to automate something. With Zapier, you can roll out AI powered workflows that do real work across your whole company in days, not weeks. I use Zapier every single day. It automatically responds to leads with enriched personalized data. It checks my calendar weekly and offers smarter ways to manage my time. And it even drafts emails for [music] every new request that lands in my inbox. All of that running quietly in the background so [music] I can focus on the work that matters. And Zapier's built for scale with enterprisegrade security, compliance, and governance. It's trusted by teams at Dropbox, Airbnb, Open Door, and thousands more. Go to try.zapier.com/howi to learn more about how Zapier can bring the power of AI orchestration to your entire org. Let's talk a little bit about this this prompt. So tell me what first kind of summarization exercises you want to do here. >> Yeah. So basically here and the reason I can use a model like GB like like a GPT4 is and and you know part of it again is just keeping up with continuing to update the models but I don't fix things if they're not broken. So this particular Zap works perfectly for us and it gives us everything we need and we don't need more rigor in analysis here because it's just some core things that we want to identify. So, I'd rather not spend the extra money and even go through it. But at certain point, if it didn't work, I would look at models if it wasn't going fast enough. What's interesting is the older models tend to work faster and faster and faster over time and they actually error out less and and sometimes the older models get updated as a newer models update as well. So, it's not like you're you're driving in an 84 Chevy, so to speak. So, here this is a key step. This is called core summary generator. And what this is asked to do is analyze the customer success call transcript between Susie and our client to gauge the health of customer relationships and identify improvement areas start summaries with the customer's company name key participants and then kind of going through it ask for the key stakeholders and then it gives a call overview we describe the call's purpose the main topics and the outcome exclude small talk and then I have a variety of different instructions assess the overall customer sentiment noting any frustrations or concern provide a sentiment score from 1 to 10 where 10 reflects high satisfaction and one indicates potential discontinuation of our services. This is the key thing because it allows us to quantify customer sentiment over time and we actually benchmarked this against actual churn. So and and it's been highly predictive um in terms of the if you take the average sentiment score of customer calls over the past year, it's a huge predictor of if the customer is not just going to turn, but are they going to upsell if they're really happy? also one great thing the customer successfully did on the call kind of identify that and what are some things that they actually could have done better and then list key next steps. So this is basically just an overarching prompt where it'll take a uh a transcript and it'll identify all this information for me and then that content I can do a variety of different things with but it's a huge part of the overall output. So one of the things I want to call out here as I was reading your prompt is in an ideal world all your best CSMS are doing this after every call in a perfect way with great you know objective self evaluation all this kind of stuff and the reality is we're all so busy that you know your customer success folks or your sales folks are probably going meeting to meeting to meeting and at the end of the day trying to figure out their notes and put little things in and I just think what's nice about this is you can make the customer success or account manager's job a lot easier and let them be exceptional at their job by automating some of the work that they they would do. And so I think it's a really good hygiene step for anybody to think, you know, after I'm coming out a meeting, if I were to do my best job possible, what are the five things I would do coming out of each meeting? And then just automate that for yourself. And then you know that every time you're going to be doing that. >> Yep. So the bunch of other steps I have and I'm not going to go through all of them because there's a ton of them. But basically it it looks up the user on Slack. So I understand the user main our employee on Slack. It identifies the people who aren't from our company. So you can kind of exclude them. Um it's able to find the user here. So I use Slack as a as a lookup sometimes because our companies from Power Directories on Slack. So if I'm trying to get someone's email address in automated fashion and I have their name, I can actually use Slack as a lookup tool in Zap without even actually posting anything to Slack. So sometimes these tools actually can be used for other purposes that's not their core purpose. And then basically the fir one of the main things I do from this is I send a channel message. So basically after the call is done you can see new customer success caller has the account the opportunity the leader of the call from our company the date of the call and it basically has that summary um that gets sent out. So we have a we have a channel that that's a constant feed that I obviously the CEO I'm very attuned to and I'll I'll share it right now where basically every time a customer call is done it just pops up on Slack and I'm able to really you know we have 300 employees at our company and I'm really able to get a sense of the kind of pulse of the company what customers care about just based upon looking at at something like this and it's you know that alone if that was the only invention that came out of a high. It would be pretty incredible if you think about it. And this is just like one of many things that we do. So I'm going to pull up and slap right now. As you can see here, this is a sample call and it shows who the CA key stakeholders will were uh what the call attempted to establish, what was the sentiment score, got an eight, right? Opportunities for upselling feedback and next steps. And it has basically a transcript here. And it's great for us to do if a customer is not happy, right? If they um you know, for some reason uh score below a seven, we have a churn uh notification channel um where basically it's called churn early warning system where it'll tell us if a customer is not happy for whatever reason. and and and we've had to modulate it cuz sometimes a client will say they're not h it'll say the client's not happy but maybe they're just not happy with how their business is going. So it it's it's not always like a science. Um, and then in the channel sometimes the rep will say, \"Oh, no, they're fine. It's just this.\" But we have in many instances, and to your point earlier, like sometimes the the rep might not want to tell anybody, right? Maybe it's a Friday afternoon, they just don't want to deal with it. And then what happens is we end up forgetting about it and then the customer turns three months later and we're like, \"Why didn't you just tell us?\" We don't have to do that anymore. We don't have to ask somebody how that call went with Proctor and Gamble. It's just here. >> Yep. Okay, great. So, we keep the transcript. You post all of them. So everybody in the company has access to customer calls and summaries which is just great for general sentiment analysis, knowledge sharing, transparency. You take any ones where the sentiment analysis is low and you put them in sort of like a warning area churn alert channel um where I'm sure you're paying a little extra attention so you can get ahead of potential churn risks which as a B2B girl I really really love. And then so that's that's a little bit more like the account ops side of things, but then I know you take off a bunch of marketing. >> Yeah, there's a bunch of other things. Yeah. So this next one, again, this is all part of the same automation is another LLM call where we're basically describing what Suzie does and we're saying analyze the key areas of interest data in the transcript and output a bunch of keywords that we should be buying in Google. So if customers are using words that we that are describing what they're interested in or what we sell and we're not running Google keywords for them, we want to. So basically these keywords will be mentioned, we extract them and then we run an automation to add those keywords to our Google campaigns automatically. >> So not only are you taking sort of this is I love this one, so I want people to pay attention. So, not only are you taking the account level specific uh context, but you're saying our customers will tell us in their words what they're looking for, what problems they're trying to solve. These customer calls are a rich source of market insight. And so you're going to use these customer calls to actually extract out market surface areas, keywords, places where you can put marketing dollars against and then reach customers similar to the customers that you're successful with, which is a really nice closed loop solution. Um, and again, >> that's right. >> You know, we were talking about how this note summary is the the way in an ideal world a customer success manager would provide notes. In an ideal organization, your, you know, paid search manager would be monitoring all these calls and doing all this for you. But we don't live in ideal worlds and people are busy. And so again, this is is not only designing from the point of view of like what would a person do, but also what would a team do. >> That's right. The other thing we do is we've done a coach into this. So the next step essentially is called individual call feedback. And what this does is it actually creates a feedback note to the person on the call. So this just goes to the sales rep on the on the sales or customer sales rep saying here's what you did, here's what you did right, here's what you did wrong and actually sends it to them right afterwards so they understand how to get better, which is something that we would had to hire somebody to be on their back and tell them which they know on their own. What's interesting is like the people that really want to get better, this is AI is an incredible tool because they're going to want this feedback. And the people who never really wanted to hear from anyone to begin with, they're not going to want to hear this, but they wouldn't have been good in either way. So that kind of goes to the point that like it's going to make the good people that much better, right? And we add this to a data set. So we have a a feedback called data set. So we can actually see are there trends like is AI detecting that this person always cuts calls short or they always interrupt the customer or they don't talk about and then when it comes time to reviewing them it's all data driven it's not just myopic if if managers change over we have all this information and the good ones want this information. Yeah, what I was actually going to reflect on is you're talking about this from the point of view of the individual contributor, the CSM, the AE, but what I was thinking is so much of AE and CSM performance is really gated on do they have a good sales manager coach? Do they have a good SVP sales that can actually provide them targeted coaching on all of their right when it's relevant? >> And this sort of like evens the playing field. Your manager could be great, your manager could be terrible. in every call you're going to get kind of objective feedback on your performance and so again it helps uplevel the performance across the organization >> and it's democratized you're right 100%. The other thing we realized going back to problem solving is we heard from our sales team and our customer team you know it takes so much time for us to write a good follow-up email after the call. So now we added follow-up email writer where essentially you write an email that they we that they would want to send as a follow-up to the call and actually just and and it's designed very well and it's sent to them for them to basically copy and paste it and send it and it's just a way for them so right after the call they'll get the feedback in their inbox and they'll get this email and they can copy and paste and send or edit it and you know we could have made this automated but you know that's where the human in the loop matters right we don't what if there's the context is wrong what if they don't want to send the feedback right away? What if they want to copy somebody new? So that's why we have to have a human in the loop here. So the churn early warning detector basically sends through two different paths and these paths essentially um kind of dictate who we should notify and who we shouldn't. So we've also now started to do much more marketing driven things from this data. One of which is we start to create a database. This is called customer profile database. And what customer profile database does is essentially structures data after each call with things like what's the role of the customer, what product areas of Suzie are they most interested in, what business trends are they most interested in, and we have a structured database across all the calls which gets fed into a GPT. So if a salesperson is going into a call with a brand manager of an automotive company, they could say, \"What are the things that brand managers of automotive companies are most interested in in terms of trends of interest or our product?\" And it'll tell them right away because the data in aggregate is stored with a different tool that we deploy. So again, not only do we have the automated things that are happening, but we have this aggregate database that we unlock the value of on an ongoing basis. >> Okay. I have to ask you a question again. as a B2B enterprise girl, are you using a CRM? Like, is this data going into Salesforce? Are you like, >> \"Yes, >> it can can all go in Google Sheets. We don't care.\" I'm just curious. >> Well, I mean, you know, >> today goes in the Salesforce, but the you know, I think the reason Mark Beni off is leaning into agent forces for that reason, right? It's like what's the point, right? So, like theoretically everything I'm building right now is a better what I just showed you I believe is a better version of Salesforce. And guess what? The salesperson doesn't have to enter a record. It's entered and the manager is getting information and they can chat with the data and they can pull reports and aggregate. That's basically what Salesforce was built for. And you know, from a meta standpoint, our company is facing the same thing with market research where like we built the smart. So we're all trying to figure out how to disrupt ourselves based upon what's happening. But you're right. I mean, and that's sort of the fundamental issue that exists today. >> What I was reflecting on though is one of the challenges with Salesforce. Well, you know, one of the reasons Salesforce did so well is because of the flexibility of implementing your own data schema and kind of >> Yeah, of course. >> And one of the limitations is like gosh, you have to go through your Salesforce admin to like set up anything and get, you know, and then the charts and graphs weren't great and no one really knew how to I mean, you just sometimes want to know like what's the status of the PNG account. It's what you want to know and it's just good luck getting that dumb where right now you could just literally just speak it or type it and you get it. And that's kind of where we're all heading to. >> Yeah. And then what you're showing is you could create these oneoff loosely structured Google Sheets for example for different various lookups. They don't have to be perfect. They don't have to be hardened in your CRM, but they're useful to your team. And I think >> it's structured. It's a structured database which you know I think you know for rag structured databases work much better. And this is a structured database and that's really all you need. I think a key point here it goes back to what I mentioned earlier is you just have to find it. It's not about the tool, it's about the data. People are so focused on the application layer. It means nothing without the data. And to me, it's like this is the ultimate source of data. And this is the treasure trove and this is people in the wild saying what they want. So I want to build everything on top of this data. So that's why when when we were prepping for today's interview, you're like, we'll show a bunch of different things and and the way I look at it differently. I'm gonna show you one thing that has many different tentacles based on the most important thing which is what our customers are saying and that's a different way of looking at it. >> Yeah. And I want you to show one more sort of marketing use case off this master workflow. But while you're that up, >> what I might encourage people to think about is >> think of yourself as a single workflow. Think of your team as a single workflow. Maybe even think of your company as a single workflow and figure out how that whole thing should work. and then work your way into some of these automations is really interesting as opposed to these little micro task kind of style things. You can really ladder it up to what's the step-by-step process this this team should follow um given a certain task. And so I think it's really interesting that you have this this mega automation as opposed to these little oneoff one-off things. So this the last one I'll show you which is this one was controversial at first and it required massive testing to push it live which is so we speak to somebody say a financial service brand and they talk Susie is a market research company right so we compete with companies like call tricks and survey monkey etc so we're going to have a we had a call in with a financial services company and they want to name a new product say it's a new credit card or something that's a use case that other financial services companies might want to use us for. Now, obviously, we can't share that X Bank is thinking about renaming something. So, we but we want to share that Suzie can do this new use case. So, what we did is we've done an automation where it basically extracts any identifying information from the call. So, basically that includes the brand, the brand name, any specific strategy that the company had, anything that's identifying to them at all. we redact and we have to test it over and over and over again to make sure that nothing could get through that could be because we'll lose customers and and we breach car. So we can't do any of that but at the same time if a salesperson just talked to a beverage company about you know testing packaging they're very welcome the next call say yeah just spoke to another company about this and that's kind of what we want to have a programmatic approach to. So, what this does is it'll take those transcripts and it'll write a blog post that fully redacts all that specified information, but focuses just on the idea of what we talked about. It'll create a graphic, a headline. It'll even create a custom um CTA at the bottom and it will and it'll optimize it for SEO and it publishes it on our blog and it publishes it 21 days later which is just something that we want to do to even make sure to the nth degree that any privacy or anything. So we we but now we have 10,000 blog posts that are created on the calls that we're making without any human intervention. It just goes it goes and goes and goes. um every single use case that you can think of and now we're running ads against these through Google dynamic search ads. So, you know, and we're starting to get now it takes a while to gain SEO traction with stuff like this. But even before that, now if someone searches for anything that Susie has possibly talked to somebody about, we have a blog post up there and we run ads against it. >> This is this is amazing. I love this. This gives me so many ideas. And what I like about this is it's taking again your richest source of insight about not just what a customer wants, but what the marketer want, what the market wants, >> and creating assets that then you can use to go reach similar customers with similar problems. So again, your most successful customers are going to look like your most successful customers. And so you want to go find more more of those folks. So again, to recap for everybody, a single don call generates a summary, a Slack post, a turn risk alert, a follow-up email, a coaching email to the CSM. Um, it enriches a bunch of data. It sends out auto automations. It identify keywords for you to bid on and it generates content for you to both bid on and send paid traffic to but also generate to get organic traffic going off one call. So the other thing I want to call out for people is in this age of AI and automation, you can take a very simple asset and extract the like nth degree of value out of that asset which I think is such a useful and helpful workflow for people. So Matt, we had this is a how I AI first. You have created such a big workflow that we have only shown one >> and I think that's enough and we'll have people reach out to I know you have a couple other really interesting workflows, but we're going to get back you back to building Zaps and running this amazing team. Before I let you go, let me ask um two lightning round questions and then we'll we'll get you out of here. One is, you know, as I've been reflecting, this is a good reflection of how great individual contributors work or how great teams work. How has this changed how you think about building the shape of your team in your startup right now? Yeah, I think it's far more individual contributors, far more people who want to put their hands on keyboard, people who are willing to learn, um people who are motivated and ambitious that are that are proactive at finding solutions. I think those are the people who are going to drive the next great businesses, not order takers, not people who walk in the work every day and wait to be told what to do because you could just you could you could just solve what I'm able to do if I tell AI what to do. So I don't need more people to tell what to do. I need people who are going to come up with new ideas and solutions and be proactive. >> Yeah. What I say is this is the age of the super icy. Like if you can be a super icy, you are going to go so so far, >> you know. Second question, who do you think should own this inside your team? I know you're building a lot of it, but is this a role? Is this everybody's job? Who do you think needs to be thinking about building these kinds of automations? Well, I I think that you need like a couple of G go to market orchestrators that are are almost like general contractors that are looking at the blueprint of all different automations, but then I think you need people who are owning the output of those automations. And so the marketing team should know the output of the blogs and if that's not working, they should go to the, you know, the automation team and say, well, this is breaking, how do we make it better, etc. I think that's the best design, but it does require definitely new roles in the organization. >> Yeah, for sure. And then of course the last question which is prompting techniques when AI is not giving you what you want. What do you do? Maybe in chat GPT like do you bribe? Are you an all caps person? What do you do? >> I I have a framework where I first set what I'm trying to accomplish and then I kind of set the framework for the prompt like almost like guardrails like here's what not to do. Uh, and then and then I think for me telling it what not to do is a great way of kind of eliminating the issues I see until I get close and when I get it close to it outputting something I actually want then I refine what I wanted to actually do and I think that's generally how I go about it. >> Okay. So you're doing guardrail prompting do not do in addition to this is I want you to accomplish. Well Matt, this has been amazing. I love this. I'm actually going to go steal a bunch of your ideas for my own. >> Please do. >> Enterprise pipeline. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? >> Uh you can find learn more about me at mattbritton.com. Um I just uh rolled out a new book in May called Generation AI. So definitely check that out. It's about generation alpha and the AI generation. And then you can learn more about my company Suzie at suzie.com suzy.com. >> Well Matt, I really appreciate it.

    "transcript": "[music] Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have an episode that so many of you have asked me for, which is Claire, if I have literally never written a line of code, I have no idea what I'm doing, I do not know how to run anything [music] locally, how do I get started with AI assisted coding, vibe coding, so I can just learn the basics. And in today's mini episode, I'm going to show you exactly how to do that or exactly how I would do it. and I'm doing it completely live. So, we have a couple hiccups, but we eventually get to a personal project hub that can be run locally [music] on your machine that lets you generate docs via AI and prototype designs that you could share just with yourself or with your team. I hope this is what I'm calling a safe space episode for you to really get started as a beginner using some of these coding tools and learn how to leverage this technology to build interesting things for yourself and eventually for your team. Let's get to [music] it. Today's episode is brought to you by ChatPrd. I know that many of you are tuning into how I AI to learn practical ways you can apply AI and make it easier to build. [music] That's exactly why I built ChatPRD. Chat PRD is an AI co-pilot that helps you write great product docs, automate tedious coordination work, and get [music] strategic coaching from an expert AI CPO. And it's loved by everyone from the fastest growing AI startups to large enterprises with hundreds of PMs. [music] Whether you're trying to vibe code a prototype, teach a firsttime PM the ropes, or scale efficiently in a large organization, Chat PRD helps you do better work fast. And we're integrated with the tools you love, vzero.dev, Google Drive, Slack, Linear, Confluence, and more. [music] So you don't have to change your workflow to accelerate with AI. Try ChatPRD free at chatpd.ai/howi ai. And let's make product fun again. There's this concept I have in teams that I run where we don't call questions dumb questions. We call them safe space questions. And the number one safe space question I still get is how do I actually get started coding with AI if I have never written a line of code in my life? And we've had a couple episodes kind of giving you oneonone on vibe coding and creating prototypes. Um, we had Lee at cursor walk through some of the components of cursor, but still we have not shown you how to go from zero code, no files, nothing to a codebase that you can start to work on locally and learn a little bit more about these AI assisted engineering tools like Herser, like Claude Code or even just create a little space for yourself to experiment. So today's mini app is going to be a building episode and we are going to do it live and there might be some rough edges because I don't have anything baked right now. I'm going to show you how I would do this if I was starting completely from scratch and we will see how far we can get in terms of standing up a little personal app on your desktop to code with using AI. And I'm going to try to make this accessible for people who are not software engineers in your day-to-day. But this is a great episode for software engineers who want to share this with their PMs on their team, designers on their team, or their friends looking for a way to go zero to one with coding. Caveats here. Again, I did not plan this out, so we're doing it live. Two, we are not going to stress out about the quality of the code right now. What we want to start with is can I get something running locally that's useful that I understand some of the components of and we're going to do it really fast. So it's not going to have tons of functionality but it's going to get you started. And for everybody listening I'm going to use a couple tools today. I'm going to use chat purity really quickly. I'm probably going to prototype a little bit in Vzero by Versel. I'm going to bring it into cursor. I will show you how to optionally or additionally use claude code and we might bring in some other exciting tools along the way. So um this is one where if you want to get the YouTube up on one side and your screen up on the other and follow along I will try to make it as simple as possible to get started with nothing and then have a AI coded codebase by the end of this. Let's see if we can do it 30 minutes. Okay, to get started, I'm going to share my screen. And like all good products and like all good founders, I am going to start with um writing a requirements document. And we're going to make this really simple. And I thought what would be a good use case that's pretty accessible to everybody. And I thought this idea of kind of a personal product hub would be really useful, especially as folks that have followed along our recent episodes with Dennis from Chime about AI powered product management, some of our prototyping, um, with cursor episodes with Elizabeth Lynn. I think just like kind of this personal hub where you're going to play with AI stuff is the way to go. So, I'm going to say help me write a document chapter and I'm just going to say personal project so it doesn't think I'm working on my own product. a minimal simple hub for working on two things. Oops. Pressed enter. So, it's going to be really anticip anticipate what those two things are. The two things are going to be the documentation, PRDS and ideas. The second thing is small interactive prototypes. I want a web app with basically two navigation items on the left. Um, docs and prototypes. And I will turn this into a nextjs app where I can write docs in markdown and I code little prototypes. Okay, so this is what I'm imagining. I'm imagining I'm going to make Claire's hub for product work. It's going to be a super minimal web app. I want docs where I'm going to like basically use AI to write PRDs and other docs and ideas. and then another folder where I write prototypes and maybe show you how to use cursor or these other tools to like buy code little prototypes in this folder that then you can see over time and the core audience is myself. So this is just for me um so I can build something simple. You can hear my typing because I have nice nails today. but it's going to write me a quick PRD um for my personal project um and really outline what I want to do. The reason why I like to start with PRDs is really you just get better results out of the next step which will be a kind of like vibe coding prototyping step. And so while this is a little bit of time, I think it's really worthwhile to do because then in our next step, we're not going to be spending so much time on prompting and other aspects of this work. So this is going to generate a PRD. We'll probably like spin through and come back when it's ready and send it over to Vzero. Okay, my document is done. I'm just going to just read the top. I'm gonna be the laziest PM because again, this is a mini episode, not a big episode. And my general goal, I want to quickly draft down product ideas and mark down format. I want to simply seamlessly switch between writing pods and coding prototypes. I want to organize my documents. I want to see a live preview. Okay, sure, why not? This looks great. So then I'm just going to open this in Vzero, which is my preferred um prototyping app for this particular use use case. The reason why um I like V0 for my initial prototyping is one, the UI tends to be pretty like streamlined and nice looking and pretty. Um two, it's going to be really easy to take this into the next step of getting it in GitHub, getting it in cursor, and actually deploying it. And I find that people often think that the scariest part is actually connecting their vibe coding um their vibe coding prototype with an actual deployed experience. And I think Versell's done a nice job, shout out to my friends over there, um of setting that up. That being said, like pick your vibe coding platform of choice. Lovable is lovely, Bolt is lovely, Replet is lovely. All of them are lovely. Um, I'm just going to prefer this one for this workflow because I'm actually going to pull this into code and show you some alternate ways you can deploy this app at some point and I know that's a part that a lot of you have questions about or are curious about. So, it's going to help me build this personal project hub. Um, a couple kind of like keywords for you all as you go down this um, vibe coding path is Verscell is definitely going to build this in Nex.js. So, it's going to be um, JavaScript focused. I always tell people if you're trying to get started with coding with AI, you pick one of two languages. You pick Python because it's easy to read um, or easy to write and read and you pick JavaScript because it's easy to see. Um, I don't think JavaScript is actually the most readable language. Python, I think, is like really easy. You can literally read it and understand what's happening. Um, JavaScript's a little little more fancy. Um, has a a couple um syntactical things that are pretty unique to that ecosystem, but JavaScript you can like get a website out of which which we all all really like. And there's a couple extra hops uh and steps with Python. So, this is going to generate basically an X.js um app and repository for you that I'm actually eventually not even going to use in V 0ero. I'm going to pull into Cursor. So, you can see here it's building a lot of these components we talked about. Again, for people who are like, I have no idea where to start. I downloaded Cursor, I opened it up, what do I do? There really are two steps. You could do this whole step in cursor. Start from zero. It will definitely scaffold out a repository for you, but I like for beginners to start in a vibe coding kind of platform like this because you can really see it first. They have this web- based browser that you can look at. You don't have to worry about running it locally and you can really focus on the things that I know some of you non-technical people care about which is like how it looks and how it works and then we'll we'll worry about the code. And I feel like something like starting with an IDE like when surfer cursor VS code or whatever you really start worrying about the code too early for somebody who is not technical. So let's let this generate and then I will come back and show you how I will pull this into cursor. This is still generating. And one of the things that I want to call out for people, again, we are doing this live, so I'm going to show you exactly the pros and cons of following a flow like this is I did make a pretty good PRD, but I did try to tell it to keep it simple. And what I've noticed as a lot of these um AI assisted coding platforms try to take more more of the end to end application building and are trying to compete on the complexity and completeness of the applications they can generate. What I have noticed over the past couple of months is that I've seen a lot of scope creep um be built into how these more agentic implementations of these coding tools work than maybe we want. And so again, I wanted it very simple. I wanted a place for my documents. I wanted a place to prototype code. Um I wanted it in markdown. And it's building me a bunch of stuff. I don't need file management um a sand I saw it had a sandbox um for coding like all sorts of things that I didn't actually say I wanted and is far beyond I think the complexity of the product I wanted to generate for this use case. So we're going to see what we end up with. Otherwise we'll take a different path. And again, I'm just showing you this so you all can understand what you're going to get out of these tools and how you may have to back out of a current path in order to find the right path for you moving forward. And so it may have been a mistake to generate this because the app, the Vzero app went like ham on the requirements. to build me something very fancy, which is nice, but is maybe beyond what I wanted to start with. So, I'm going to see here documents. Okay, we got errors already off to a bad start. Let's go back to the home prototypes, but no, I don't want this. I don't want this code here. I just wanted the code to be generated normally. So, you know what? This is a bust. And that's okay. Even for a mini EP here, having this be a bust just shows you if you play with these tools, you can figure out the right workflow for you. And then it's pretty cheap to walk away. I've spent I'm looking at our recording timing. I've spent 10 minutes so far on all of this, including mostly waiting time on loading, and it didn't end up what I wanted. And guess what? Totally fine. So, we're going to back out. We're going to give up on our viide coding platform because it's going to take too much back and forth to get to the simple thing I want. And I am going to start this from scratch directly in cursor. Okay, so that was a total bust. We made a PRD. We tried to vibe code it. The vibe coding was way too complicated. I don't actually want it to be that complicated for the sake of this quick start tutorial. So, we're going to go directly into cursor and see what it looks like in that direction. And so I have opened cursor. It is um opened to a empty directory. That directory is actually named Civo because this is going to be my personal project. There are no files. There is nothing in it. So all you have to do is go into your file browser, create a folder that's empty, open that folder in cursor. And then I want to show a couple things about cursor 2.0 that have been um released in the last week. One is they now have two different views. An agents view which is much more focused on what you're going to build and um instructing the agent or multiple agents that are working in your codebase. And then editor view, which is very similar to what Lee showed us in a couple episodes ago, which is your files on your left. I have zero files. Your code in the middle, and then your chat or agents on the right. And I'm actually going to use the agents flow for this because again I'm trying to get started for beginners and I want to show you how easy it is to run. So I'm going to go to agents and I will zip back to my I will zip back to my PRD. I am actually just going to copy this markdown because I'm feeling super lazy. And I'm going to say I want a very simple next.js JS app set up where I can keep a repository of markdown docs, prds and code in different directories, little um prototypes that will be displayed in the app. Here is a prd but keep it super basic. The other thing I'm going to show here is I'm going to use um cursors new model composer one. The reason why is this is a mini app and composer one is so freaking fast. It is fast. You guys did a good job there. Um of course you could switch what model you want to use, but we're going to use composer one for the sake of this and see how far we get. Oh, I should also say up here to keep it super basic. We're starting from scratch. So, give me all all the steps I need to set up and run this. Okay. So, let's see what um this cursor agent does. It's going to run a bunch of install files. So, it's going to create a next app. It's going to install TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, a bunch of stuff. Um, essentially just a couple libraries that will be very useful for you to use. Um, TypeScript will be the typing language and the types will be the types. Tailwind is a really nice CSS library that makes things look nice. ESLint make sure you write good code and it's creating the project structure. It's double-checking it. It's also installing a couple libraries including displays of markdown and GitHub flavored markdown which is GFM if anybody's curious about that. And it's starting to write a couple pages for me. And so again, look at this thing. It is blazing fast. Rumor on the street is it's a uh a trained Chinese model. So we'll see what kind of non-English language characters we can force this thing to to show up. But um why I like composer one, again, this is not the most complicated app in the world that we're building. It is not super fancy. I just want to show you how fast it is. So again, maybe this was the right way to do it for beginners, which is, you know, if your vibe coding tool is just going too far in terms of how to uh what features are in your app, just go to cursor and start from scratch and use composer 1. It'll keep it very simple. Now, I have in the editor a bunch of files. Does this help any of you that are new to coding? Absolutely not. Do you know what these files mean? No way. Do you want to look at files when you are building an app? No, you want to look at apps when you're building an app. And so you can just really just go into the agent and say, \"Cool, but how do I run this?\" And it will actually give you the instructions on how to run this. So this is running a campaign. Uh this is running a command. npm rundev runs a local server for your um app. Okay. And we can pull this up. And now I have running locally on localhost uh 3001. I have my personal project hub. You can see this welcome document. Perfect. This is exactly the level of complexity I wanted. And then prototypes, which is just a little um hello world prototype. I don't actually want the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exposed here. So, I'm going to go back to agents and I'm going to say you got this almost right. You got this almost right, but I don't need the code snippets snippets in um the prototype section. I just need to be able to put routes. Routes are like page paths. if you don't know routes in this app that I can fill with code components and display to my colleagues. So again, it thought that I wanted like a real prototyping tool. Um Vzero thought I wanted a very real prototyping tool. I just want literally a place to show show some things. And so it's generating an update. And so now you can create and edit markdown documents. You can um show prototypes and routes. And let's see if it has improved what I want to see. Yeah, switching storing component code directly in the rout route files which is exactly what I want. Again, you don't have to read this code. Maybe I'll release this repo and you all can fork it and try for yourself. But it's moving very fast to create a second part where I can put some code in. And the reason why I want to do this is I want to show you how you can manage documents in a cursor repository like this. And then I want to show you how you can manage code in a repository like this. Again, I am not going to explain to you what this code means. You can use the cursor chat to read all the code, explain what it means. We're just going to trust that it shows up in the web app and it's what I want. We're running it locally. There is very little minimal risk here for the most part. Um it's a pretty simple thing and so I just want to give you all a couple ideas on how to get started 0ero to one with something that's really simple in cursor. Okay, this is exactly what I want, which is I don't want the app to like let me create prototypes. I literally just want to be able to code them and show them to you all. And so I just have to create directories in this directory in my codebase and show them with documents. It's really cool how it works. So one of the things I would do once this is done is I would say this is exactly what I want. Please explain to me how the two um userfacing functions work and actually put some instructions on the homepage. So again, I'm not going to read the code. We're doing this fast, but I do want to make sure I understand how it works. And so it's going to put in some documentation directly in the um homepage of my app to explain how it works. So okay, let's read how documents work. I click a new doc. It creates a markdown document. Files are stored in the docs directory which is great. Can be edited directly in the browser with live preview which is exactly what I want. And prototypes I just manually create them in my code editor. Any directory I create in the prototypes will automatically appear here. and I can create a demo page app and it will go. Now, this is exactly what I wanted to start with. Again, about 10 minutes to get this going and it's a much simpler place for us to start working on our personal project hub. And so, while I had a misfire with a vibe coding tool, does not does not really matter. All that matters is that I got to the thing that I wanted to get to. So let's talk about next how I would actually use each of these kind of flows. How I would set up some cursor style rules and agents to kind of manage what um how my work happens here. And I'll show you how to create a document and how to create a prototype in vibe code along the way. Okay. So I was a lazy girl and did not initialize a GitHub repo. But this is a very important step for any of the technical non-technical folks out there. I know for software engineers, git is sort of secondhand on how we manage our code projects. But again, this is a safe space episode. So we are going to tell you um how to initialize a GitHub repo and what you could use it for. And again, this is an episode for nontechnical folks. Just use the GitHub desktop app. It will make the primitives of Git in terms of files, change tracking, diffs, pull requests so much easier to learn if you visually use the downloaded GitHub desktop app versus trying to understand this through the command line. So, it's one of these things that um sure you can have your AI agent sort of like vibe code you commits and things like this using git in the CLI and I just think the visual of the GitHub desktop app is really going to help you understand what's going on in your code. And so, we're going to add this repository to GitHub. I it is in my projects and it's called SIBO. Um and we're going to create that repository. We're just going to yeah add some stuff to the git ignore file. Create the repository. Let's see what's happening. It should be creating this in my GitHub app. And it has. And you can see my initial commit has all the original files. And then um get ignore which is what files are going to be ignored by git. I'm just going to commit everything. And we should be good to go here. We'll see how how it goes. Um, you can see how git works by if I added something to this new doc, new headline, saved it, and I switched over into my GitHub repository. Actually, I you you can't see me point at the I'm going to do this here. You can actually see this change here. Green means added, red means removed. And as you can tell, it's a great way to track the changes that are happening in your application. I'm actually going to discard those changes. And you can see here they are discarded here in my code. So now that I have GitHub running, what's great is I can start actually working in this app. And again, if you all um don't remember, it does sort of two things. My app does two things. It tracks documents and it helps you create prototypes. So, we're going to go through how I would set up a personal project hub to do both of these things, showing off some of the use cases of um cursor and then maybe we'll show a little bit of cloud code as well. So, if I were creating a personal hub for documentation, one of the things that I would do is actually create some rules. And I would create those rules in an agents folder because I want a documentation agent. And so I'm going to create a new folder called agents. And I'm going to create a new file called prd.md. And that agent is going to um help me create PRDs. And I'm going to say in this chat, can you fill out P sign prd? This is a blank file to be agent instructions to write a great PRD in the appmention docs. See if it's showing the folder in the docs folder. Um, PRDS should be in markdown and the instructions should be less than 500 lines long for our AI agent to follow. Okay, so this is just a unique um way to define, you know, in cloud code it's called a skill. Here in cursor you can make it a little agent instruction. And what's nice is you can have the AI actually create it for you. So this is my PRD writing agent instructions. Um it tells it who you are. Here's the purpose. Here's the structure requirements, etc. Now what I'm going to say is we're rolling solo. I don't need an executive summary because I just don't care about executives because I don't have any right now and I want my PRDs to be much more functional. So what I would say is this is fine but make the template much more functional around technical requirements versus business requirements for right now for this use case. Um so again it's going to refactor this file and give um some improvements on the template and you will see those improvements be shipped into this file. And then what I'm going to use is I'm going to use this file to then write PRDS moving forward. Um you can see it's it's going very very fast. I'll let it finish up then I'll show you how I would use it. Okay. So this agent file is done and you can see here it gives it a role some core principles on its purpose a PRD structure and then it should give at the end if it's a good um agent uh a checklist of steps to follow. And so this is just going to be additional instructions that I'm going to be able to feed into cursor when I write a PRD. And this is saved in this agents folder. This is where I like to put my instructions. Just a really easy way to app mention them. Keeps them organized and you can create as many of these as you want. Okay, so since I've written this code, I'm just going to bop over to GitHub desktop and see that that code was added. And then I'm going to commit this to main. Don't tell the engineers. We're just going to commit to main today. Um I will talk about branches another day, but today we're just committing to the main branch because I'm just running this locally. And so I'm going to commit this agents PRD. And I'm just going to select this file and say create prd. That's a perfectly fine placeholder um commit. And now that code has been committed to my repository. Now what's really nice about this is if I go in my history, I can actually undo the commit. I can amend the commit. I can do a bunch of stuff. And this just lets you check in step by step the changes you've made to your files. Okay. And then how would I use this agent? So really easy. I would say great now write me a PRD for what do we want to prototype today? Oh, I'm working with my kid. So this again, it's a very personal u personal repository. I'm working with my kid on helping him do gardening and like weeding and sweeping work for our neighbors in the city. And so I'm going to do help me write a PRD for a little scheduling app where my kid can have our neighbors schedule help with weeding, taking out trash cans and sweeping their driveways. Okay, this is very important stuff. And what it's going to do is it's going to read that PRD uh markdown file that agent instructions and then cursor can actually follow those instructions to create a document in the right folder. And the reason why I give this example is of course you could just straight write a PRD in that docs folder or yes of course you could use some other template. But what I really like is just showing you how you can define a workflow in agents, reference that workflow, and then use that to create different assets in this codebase that we've created 0 to 1. So now I have this neighborhood task scheduler prd um PRD here. Now the magic will be will it show up in our app? And I think the answer is yes. Let's refresh neighborhood taskuler PRD here in the app. I can actually read it. Um here, see how it looks. It's very long. This is too long for a solo founder. So, what I might do is go back to that agents PRD and add a step that really reduces the length of those documents. Okay. So, what's the benefit of something like this? Not only can I have this nice little web app where my PRDs are displayed, I can store those PRDs or documents in a local code repository that I can edit with AI directly with cursor or whatever my AI preferred code is. I can create an agent that gives instructions on how to actually create those consistently over time. And I can do code and change tracking to see when I added new documents and how I added them. And so while this may seem like overkill, you could just do a Google doc or something like this. I think this document creation and storing and display workflow is a really nice one for anybody looking to get started with coding with AI, but needs kind of a practical application. And what I can imagine product managers do with this is start to just brainstorm in cursor. The reason why I think it's good to do that as you saw in Dennis from Chime's episode is it just gives you a way to understand a little bit more about how these tools actually work. Get more comfortable with these code editors and then as you move into M code experiences you then kind of have a sense of how all these tools work. And so just to resummarize this piece of the app, we've created half of our personal project hub app. It displays documents that we store in this documents folder in markdown in a web app. Um, and I've created an AI agent to actually create those documents, which is defined in this PRD Markdown file. Next, we're actually going to code. So, I'm going to show you how to code something like this, show it in the front end, and then we'll put a couple bows on the end and send you off at the end of this little episode. Okay, great. So, I've created a PRD with um for a little scheduling app for my kid where he can have his neighbor schedule help with weeding, taking out trash, and sweeping their driveways. Now, I want to build a prototype for how this works. And if you recall in my original requirements and in the web app the instructions basically how it works is I'm going to create routes which are little subdirectories or folders of functionality inside the prototypes page um and it will show up here in this list for people to see. Now I'm giving a simple silly example but what you can imagine is at work you could start to create just a repository of your own prototypes that you're playing with that you're looking at and you're learning to code with. So, I'm going to go back in cursor. And now that I've created this um PRD, I can say great, use this PRD to create a prototype. Clickable, but does not have to be totally functional um with database etc. in the prototypes folder so that I can show a little of how this might work. Super simple, easy peasy. Again, I want to make it a prototype. I don't want cursor to go off and like ask me to set up a database or any of those silly things. I really just want to create a clickable prototype. Again, I think this is a tip or trick for the product managers out there. when you're creating your own local repository like you can avoid stuff like figuring out o you can avoid stuff like figuring out databases especially if you're just trying to use this for prototyping which is the exact example I'm going to give so I'm going to let it run um it's going to build different files in you can see it created prototypes taskuler prototype it's creating a page I'm going to keep all those changes I'm going to bop over to the web app. I'm going to refresh. I see taskuler in here right now. And it has a sign in. Now, I don't know how this works. So, I'm going to ask the chat, do I sign in with something? How do I sign in? And it's probably going to tell me just to click the button. So, use any email and password. Perfect. Easy. So, I'm going to do hello@ chatpurd.ai. and password. And I can see that the text is gray. I'm going to actually take a little screenshot of this bad boy to fix later. Oh, okay. And then we have neighborhood tasks. And you can create a task. You can see all the different tasks. This is exactly what I wanted. So again, it's not the prettiest app. It's probably not the best code, but if you're just trying to get started with how do I start to use cursor in real code to drive value? I want to skip these vibe coding tools. I want to go straight to the code. I can actually see this and understand how this tool might work. And then I can go back and forth in cursor and explain to it what I want, how I want it to be fixed, um, all that kind of stuff. And so I'm actually going to drag that screenshot in and say it seems like fields have gray text. Please fix. And I can go back and forth and iterate on this code. If I'm feeling fancy, I can actually go into the code itself. I can read it. I can ask cursor to explain this code. Again, I'm just trying to give you inspiration as a non-technical person, how you could use something like cursor really to do very basic things in code, but that have high payoff in terms of what you see and what you learn. And so, let's see if this fixes our little login. We're going to sign out. Oh, look at that. Now, it's fixed. It looks so much better. So, we're really happy with our prototype. And you can imagine now you can just go into cursor say create a new prototype in a new folder and it will create it for you. And again of course we're going to go to GitHub. We're going to check in um scheduling prototype and commit its main. I'm going to publish this repository in my um personal repository. I'm going to call it personal project hub and publish it. That's just going to push it to the cloud so you have a place to access it online. It's not just local. And let's see. It's all looking so much better. So, I'm really happy with this. Now, I'm going to show you a couple other things that I might do in this app to make things better. Number one, I'm going to start a new agent and say, can you update the readme for this repo? The readme is generally like the front page instructions and walkthrough of how the repository works. So, I highly recommend when you get to a starting point or a stopping point with your functionality to update your readme file. This is something that agents as well as other engineers could use to understand how your code works. And so this is going to tell us what the features are, how to install it, what all the files are that we created, how to use it, etc. And that was created in just a few seconds. So that's something I highly recommend. And then again, we want to just go ahead and commit these readme changes. The second thing that I would probably do here is make it look nicer. So, I think we're going to wrap this mini episode with Claire's guide to making things look nicer in cursor. We'll see if we can do this in just a couple minutes. So, I would start a new chat here again. We're going to use Composer. It's fast. We like it. Um, and we're going to go back. I don't actually care about the prototype looking nicer. I care about this homepage looking nicer. This is really, really, really sad. So, I'm going to open cursor. I'm gonna say I don't like the baseline design of the home page of this app. Please uplevel the design to be prettier and cuter. Rename it to uh let's call it personal hub and make it less basic. Again, terrible prompting, but we're going to see what it does. It's going to review the homepage. I think prettier and cuter is great instructions here. So, we're going to see what I end up with when I prompt it to look a little bit nicer. Oh, it's going to be a cozy workspace for documents. This is I don't know. It makes me happy. It's stupid looking, but it's cute. And so again, when you're working on something locally, who cares? Make it fun, make it creative, play with stuff, add dark mode, all those things. I love it. You know, I love a gradient. You know, I love a pink. I'm going to check in these changes. I'm going to call it pretty and cute and call it a day. So this was my walkthrough of how to create 0ero to one a codebase that helps you consolidate documents including PRDS and helps you build out prototypes. And I think this is just a really good baseline repository for anybody especially product managers who are wanting to get started with writing using something like a cursor and coding using something like a cursor. And again, you can continue to extend this, add more prototypes, add more documents, and get started. So, what were our steps? We created a PRD in chat PRD. We attempted to send that PRD to vzero.app. We got way too much functionality. It was too smart for its own good. So, we started all over. We created a clean folder on our desktop. We opened that folder in cursor. We instructed it to make a Nex.js JS app that does these two things. Then we created an agents file to write our PRD documents and then we vibe coded or AI assisted coded our first little prototype that also gets to displayed in this app. Um we made it prettier. We added a GitHub repository. We checked in our code and we added a readme. So I hope this was the Safe Space episode you all were looking for. I get asked for it all the time. And if you have never written a lick of code in your life, I hope this gives you a place to get started playing with your own personal space. There are lots of other episodes of How I AI that can feed into this workflow. This is just a good one to get started. And I hope you've enjoyed this mini episode of How I AI. Thanks y'all.

You can go as broad as you like self-s serve into an unfamiliar topic just incredibly quickly. And that means you can not only deliver quicker analysis, you can just deliver much better analysis too. I'm going to start just by doing an enterprise AI search. So, I'm just going to start very simply by asking notion, what experiments were new features launched between September to December 2024 that could have added friction to the checkout process for new retailers in Europe or North America? And I've just said focus on XV docs, PRDs, and launch announcements. I've got straight away a really interesting list of hypothesis to dig into with no work. You can see it searched across Slack, notion, Jira, and everything else very, very quickly. So [snorts] Alexa, how do we do actual analysis of data when we've identified a problem or an opportunity we want to go after? >> Without AI, especially the context gathering would mean hours spent digging through all the specs and PRDS. Writing SQL queries from scratch and then you know spending a lot of time writing and editing a doc using cursor to actually create edit write SQL has been pretty gamechanging. Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. [music] Today I have a great episode with Tim and Alexa from the data team at Fair. They're going to show us how you can use cursor MCPS chat GBT and even write your own agents to do data analysis. We're going to see everything from decomposing that scary question, \"What went wrong?\" in September to doing detailed funnel analysis on experiments and surveys. Let's get to it. AI is supposed to make work easier, but I've been there. [music] Weeks of setup, endless back and forth with engineering, and yet another tool the team never really adopts. That's why I use Zapier's AI orchestration platform. It connects with nearly 8,000 apps, [music] so I can finally put AI to work without the drama, without the delays, and without pulling engineering in every [music] time I want to automate something. With Zapier, you can roll out AI powered workflows that do real work across your whole [music] company in days, not weeks. I use Zapier every single day. It automatically responds to leads with enriched personalized data. It checks my calendar weekly and offers [music] smarter ways to manage my time. And it even drafts emails for every new request that lands in my inbox. All of that running quietly in the background so I can focus on the work that matters. And Zapier's built for [music] scale with enterprisegrade security, compliance, and governance. It's trusted by teams at Dropbox, Airbnb, Open, and thousands more. Go to try.zapier.com/howi to learn more about how Zapier can bring the power of AI orchestration to your entire org. Alexa, Tim, thank you for joining How I AI. >> Well, great to be here. Thanks for having us. >> Thank you so much. >> One of the things that we can do now that I am probably personally causing in the in the internet world is we can just build a lot of a lot of product. I am always out there like I was thinking the other day I was like I'm going to tweet something where I tell PMS that they should just spend a month saying yes instead of saying no. Like let's ship some features. And I think AI has really accelerated product development, software engineering, getting innovation to the hands of customers. But the problem it has created is we don't know if those products are any any good. So the the perennial uh product problem which is you can ship things and they can not make the difference that you hope they would make. And so I'm really excited about this conversation because you are going to show us how to use AI and even some of these tools that software engineers or product managers might be familiar with to do really deep meaningful product analysis and I spent a lot of time in experimentation and so I love a good conversion rate optimization. And so Tim, we're going to kick it to you to start with. How do we start at the very beginning of analyzing kind of a product and its quality and its usage through analyzing conversion rates? >> Yeah, I love this. I think everyone's talking about Vibe coding, but no one's really talking about Vibe analysis and we're heading in that direction very quickly. So, uh, let's get into it. Um, so before we do anything too technical, I think we want to share a really broad range of examples here from the really complicated to the like actually incredibly simple. I think everyone knows PMs are going to have to become engineers and then we've got a lot of issues where all of you guys are going to have to come and analysts as well. Um, so I think there's a lot we can show here. So we want to start off with just a really simple use case that should be familiar to I think everyone listening. Uh, but I think it illustrates the point. There's often the most simple AI tools that can actually have the biggest impact here. Um, I think before we get into the actual demo, I think it's useful just to pause very quickly for a second on the question of what analytics actually is. So, I think once you break that down, you get a much clearer view of where these current tools can be most valuable. Um, I think most people jump straight to the nuts and bolts for actually manipulating and crunching data. But actually, it's really just a small part of the O4 process. And the most important often most difficult thing is actually just getting the right context in the first place because that's what separates good analysis from bad. Like you need to know to ask the right questions to come up with the right hypothesis to know what analysis is even worth doing in the first place. You need to know where the data lives and you need to be able to interpret it all very um very well. And the new AI tools have just absolutely transformed the process of just getting all that context. you can go as broad as you like self-s serve uh into an unfamiliar topic just incredibly quickly and that means you can not only deliver quicker analysis you can just deliver much better analysis too. Um so to illustrate the point I want to talk through what sandy I'm guessing is a very familiar situation where a business metric suddenly drops off a cliff uh and no one's got a clue what to do with it. Um, so I'm actually I'm going to use a real example from fair for this. Um, and this happened to our new customer conversion funnel at the end of last year. So if you've ever worked in growth, everyone's going to know new customers, they're just extremely sensitive to even the tiniest little friction. So almost anything anyone does in the business anywhere can affect these kind of things. Whether it's a signup flow, a search algorithm, a shipping policy, like this all can affect these things. Um, and if you're not careful, you're going to have to decomp the entire business. So, let me show you how these things can just be done so much quicker. Um, so imagine this problem lands on my desk. Um, I might look at a couple of just existing dashboards that exist to say, uh, what's going on here? And you can see, uh, very quickly the issues started in September and there was another drop in December. And it seems to be concentrated in the checkout stage. But beyond that, I've really got no idea what could have actually caused that. So, let's start really bored. I'm just going to share my screen. I'm going to start just by doing an enterprise AI search. Now, we use notion, but frankly, every document system now is going to have an AI system. If they haven't got one yet, it's coming. And they are just game changers. So, I'm just going to start very simply by asking notion what happened. Okay. So, the only thing I'm going to do, I'm going to just make this more realistic. I'm going to filter the date range. I don't want it cheating and looking at the answer. It's only going to have access to the things I had access to when I actually did this. So, I'm going to put it up to the end of April last year, which when I run it, okay? And then we're just going to get that running. So, if you think this, all I've asked is what experiments or new new features launched between September to December 2024 that could have added friction to the checkout process for new retailers in Europe or North America. And I just said um focus on XP docs uh PRDS and launch announcements. Okay. So, if you think about what I'd have to do in the past, I'd have to be like crawling through a million documents, doing a load of searches, going through a ton of uh different Slack channels trying to work out what's going on. And instead, look, I've got straight away a really interesting list of hypothesis to dig into with no work. And you can see it searched across Slack, Notion, Jira, and everything else very, very quickly. And uh if you let's just pull out a couple of these. So, what's happening? So, let's go. So, you've got uh clearly we launched some kind of um checkout experiment around this time. That's definitely worth looking in. Uh we've done something with a checkout blocker in Europe. Okay. Lots of interesting things to dig into. Now, with a couple of clicks, I've got a good long list, but I don't really know what these things are. So, I've got all the links of the extra documents I could go click into, but let's just ask as a starting point, uh what is Aori? Let's pick one of them. What is Aori? So, we'll just ask that. It's going to run another little search and give us more things. Now, um you've got a little bit here, but it's going to start bring up a little bit more information uh to just get a bit more um a bit more detail on this thing. So, let's see where that goes. Okay, so very quickly it's saying give me the term what it is. And you can kind of see it's okay. It's a um a regulation that's involved in Europe and someone's done something to uh start asking for more details. Clearly trying to improve checkout and conversion rates and they're trying to bring that one in. But I think this is a great starting point. I've got some detail, but I think what's really interesting here is everyone knows like a PD is one part of the story, but between a PLD being written and something going into the codebase, a lot can happen. So to actually understand what's going on, you usually need to go one layer data into the actual technical implementation. And I want to show you like a quick trick uh of how I do that. Um, so I think one of the best things about these AI tools is just the ability of someone who's like nontechnical to access things that they couldn't previously access. And a great example of that is just being able to talk to the product codebase. I'm not an engineer. I can't write Cotlin or Swift. I used to be a lawyer for God's sake. Um, instead I can run a deep research against our codebase to find out exactly what got implemented for this particular feature and when. Now I'm going to do this in two different ways. I'm going to do it on chatbt which I think is very simple and anyone can replicate incredibly quickly. Everyone's familiar with it. And I'm going to do it on cursor which is a bit more specialized but just incredibly powerful. Um so I'm going to open up a new chat and I'm going to put it into deep research mode and make sure my GitHub is connected. So all you do, it's not technical to do that. You just need to say yes a few times to get your GitHub connected. Um the only reason you do it on on deep research is just because it's the only way you can actually access it. It's going to search our codebase now um in exactly the same way it would normally search the web on a deep research. So I'm just going to put in a prompt. Let's just copy that in. Now let me talk a little bit about what this prompt is doing. So I've given it a role. I've said you're a senior staff engineer and you've got expertise in all these different code bases cotlin swift typescript and you were working at fair and I've given it a task to say please conduct a forensic investigation of the codebase to produce a comprehensive timesequence report on all changes to the eoree collection process at checkout between June 24 and February 25. So just making sure we don't miss anything and the rest is just a bit of detail as to what I want this to look like. So, I've said I want an exact sum. I want a table with all the different PRs and commits, what they've gone into, and I really wanted to focus in on the actual impact these commits had on the retailer experience. Like, explain it to me in layman's terms. Um, and then I've just put a few requirements in here just to give it a bit more context. So, be precise, simple, clear language, only use GitHub sources. I want to call out here um you're you're using this prompt in the context of sort of a what I would call like a business incident, right? New user signups just dropped. But this is a prompt that I want the engineers watching or listening to the podcast to really pay attention to because if you're in the middle of a, you know, SEV one incident and you need to trace who did what. I know so many of our engineering teams are looking either manually looking through code, looking at these specialized kind of codegen tools to do this, but probably aren't reaching for something like ChatGpt deep research to just go ahead and do this for you. And if you're a product manager looking to be helpful during an incident, this is maybe a task you can take on on behalf of your engineering team just to provide some additional context in the background. >> 100%. I think this is great for engineers. I think it's great for just getting people to talk better to engineers. I think there's just so much you can do here. So, as always, De Research is asking a few questions. So, uh, use discretion. We'll just answer a few of those to make sure we got it. Uh, use discretion and yes, please. So, that'll get it going. But no, >> you you prompt just like I do. I just say you pick, you decide, you go. I don't care. >> I think the fact the pro doesn't ask you these questions make me think it's more to like make you feel like it's doing it rather than anything else. So that's going to take a bit of time. So while that's running, I want to show you how to do this in cursor because I think >> cursor is one of those tools that everyone thinks of for vibe coders. They think of it for engineers. They're not really thinking uh about what else it can do. And I think for both analysts and non-analysts alike, it's an incredible tool. So, um I think more and more people are talking about the phrase context engineering rather than prom engineering. I love that. Um it sort of actually explains what we're trying to do here. And for me, just cursor is the ultimate context engine. You can hook it up to MCPs. Um so basically, I can hook it up to every single system in our business to get all the data I need. And that just makes it such an incredibly good accelerator for getting context from doing analysis. So I actually find increasingly this is getting better results than deep research on TPD. So both are good, both are game changers, but I think this is just a little bit quicker and better. So I'm just going to make sure my uh MCPs all hooked up. And then all I'm going to do is I'm going to drop exactly the same prompt into cursor and we'll see the two running. So exactly the same prompt. So just for context, we are not even started on our uh hasn't even got off to the races at all on on the chat. And straight away in uh in cursor, we're going and finding it's got a nice to-do list. It's saying it's going to search all the right things in GitHub. It's going to then forensically analyze it. Uh and we'll just let this run for a little bit. You can see it's already starting to pull in the code and the pull request. everyone >> one of the things that I think is interesting to call out is you know I've run a lot of product engineering data orgs before engineering certainly day one what are you doing you're getting access to all the repos you're getting set up with GitHub you're pulling your your local environment together I know that data teams often have a similar onboarding because they're working so closely with production data one of the things I think is going to change or if it hasn't already should change right now is I think product managers and designer onboarding first seven days has to include access read at least read access to GitHub, getting your local repository pulled down, getting all your MCPs set up because it just code has become now a data source for anybody doing work, not just people writing code. So I look at this and I think leaders out there need to pay attention and rethink basically their onboarding process because you don't want to be in a situation like this and go like can somebody give me GitHub like can I can I get access >> it goes even beyond that like everyone should have access to every system and it should be from day one like these tools are just the best on boarding accelerator we've seen it for analysts we've seen it for engineers suddenly people get the context very quickly okay so we're already off it's summarized everything it's written us and we're actually starting to write things out here so straight away you can see I've got a nice exact summary it's g a few things but this this is what I was most interested in. Okay, so I'm getting a table here. For those that can't see my screen, I'm getting a table with every single PR that affected this part of the flow from look, it starts in July 24 all the way to still going. Uh, but it'll probably go to somewhere like December or February depending where it's going to go with all of these things. Now, let's just call out what this is doing. So, it's giving me an exact link to the specific PR that actually pushed this into uh the codebase. It's giving me the name of it and it's giving me a summary of what it did. It's saying who was affected and it's saying what was the impact on a retail experience. Now, if anyone's done this kind of thing, it is so difficult to do and actually like pick through all the codes and actually understand what's going on on this and it can just be incredibly quickly. And so, very quickly knowing nothing about this feature, I can already start to get really smart on what happened. And I can see if I dive down here yet, you can see there was an experiment launched in midepptember, right in the sweet spot of when this uh drop first happened. And if I scroll through getting through to looking at December, uh yeah, you can see it launched all treatment all users went live. So this now looks like a really interesting potentially smoking gun that we can debug into. And so instead of spending days talking to people about all the potential hypotheses, uh I can now speak to exactly the right colleagues and have a really targeted conversation, an informed conversation right from the off with them uh to crunch through this problem in a matter of like hours rather than weeks here. So even if we've done any data crunching, this can just be absolutely gamechanging for us. >> Yeah. And it allows you to go a lot deeper than you know I've been able to do historically on these kinds of analyses. You know, when you're running these high velocity experimentation programs, you have so many concurrent experiments. You have experiments colliding with rollouts, colliding with just plain launches. And just trying to decompose what was the state of your app on any single day is really challenging. And even if you can do the manual research to get this at a feature level, like yeah, today we launched the one one page checkout. I think the real challenge is well, did we implement it well? Is there anything in there that we should like worry about? did we exclude any users from that? Like, and so I do think the ability to use code as a a detailed source of truth when doing these kinds of forensic analyses really makes the difference in figuring out what's going on with your business. >> And then getting smart enough to go one level deep as well. You can ask follow-up questions to say, uh, how did it differ for different segments? Are there other ones interested? Like you can get so much detail just by asking questions on these kind of things without speaking to any engineers. And this gives me a little bit of some inspiration on other use cases for querying your codebase in GitHub history for events. One of the things that I do very frequently is I do a very similar analysis to this, but I say what is everything that shipped in the last week from the context of a customer and then I use it to write my newsletter. So again, like I'm starting to use our codebase as a source of truth for our marketing materials. I don't have to proxy through like what was in the PRD or what did a PM write or any of that stuff. I'm just like just tell me what was in the code in the code commits because that's what I know went live. It can interpret what the customerf facing experience and intention would be and then you can create these really interesting business and market facing assets out of that. So I just think the ability to query your codebase and your GitHub history for any use case including this one is really useful. >> Yeah, I love that. >> Great. Now what what do we do after this? So you've identified you have a conversion rate problem. You've identified maybe a couple sources of the issue. you're going to go talk to your colleagues, you're going to look at the code. Um, how do we actually do some analysis or I know we said we were going to do some vibe analysis and we have seen very few numbers. So, Alexa, how do we do actual analysis of data when we've identified a problem or an opportunity we want to go after? >> Yeah. So, obviously like a quite classic analytics task. I'm going to take us through, you know, we launched a new product feature and we actually want to understand how it did. So, I'll take us end to end from understanding how the feature was built, analyzing its performance, and then producing a summary that could eventually go to our exec team. Um, like Tim kind of touched on, without AI, especially the context gathering would mean hours spent digging through all the specs and PRDs, writing SQL queries from scratch, and then, you know, spending a lot of time writing and editing a doc. So with AI, I can pull context similar to what Tim just did directly from the codebase. I can generate queries and I can draft draft a synthesized doc. Um, and so I am going to start sharing my screen. And while you pull that up, I have to say people think that why I got into AI in a deep way was because I thought it was so fun to code. And it was actually it made my sequel so much less ugly than it used to be. It was like my number one use case however many years ago. I was like, \"Thank God, now I don't have to bother my colleague with my disgusting SQL. I can bother uh AI with my horrifying SQL and it can make it a little bit more uh efficient.\" >> Yeah. I mean, even just chatgbt for the last couple months has been a j game changer for SQL queries. The problem with chat GBT is you had to spend a good amount of time giving context like the exact table names, the exact field names. And so using I mean it's not its sort of most marketed use case but using cursor which is what I'm going to show today to actually create edit write SQL has been pretty gamechanging um especially because it's so contextaw aware and I will talk about that. So cursor can take like 3 to four minutes to run some queries. So I'm going to just kick off this prompt and then I'll explain the context and what I have done. So while that's running, I will set the stage. Last month in July, we redesigned the signup flow for a new payment method that we have been piloting. And this process of signup is successful when a customer links their bank account uh for the payments. And our old flow had been live for a few months. We had a hypothesis that we could improve it. So we redesigned the flow. Because this is a pilot, we actually like didn't have enough retailers or or users. um to run an AB test. So I just needed to do a pretty straightforward, you know, how was this performing before, how is it performing after? Um historically, again, that would have meant a lot of digging through documentation or more realistically just pinging an engineer to ask questions like, okay, what did we build? Who sees it and why? What front-end events are emitted that I can use to analyze this? Um, and while I do work closely with our engineers during the endspec phase to like figure this out, those details are easy to lose track of, especially like we're often coming back to analyze things, you know, weeks or even months after the feature launched. I will say that I probably would start with notion AI context building similar to Tim, but we already showed that. So, I'm skipping straight to the codebase. And if we go up to this prompt, um, my prompts are way less pretty than Tim's. I don't like spend a lot of time on them. I feel like with cursor, you can always iterate. And so I wanted to understand the setup wizard, which is what we called this new flow. I told it to research our codebase. And I essentially asked who, what, where, when, why. And so if we go to this answer, we can see, okay, it is, you know, looking into the codebase. And you know, I'm not an engineer. I don't really know what this means, but it, you know, we called this in our code the first run user experience. And it tells me about some flags, cannot be sub users. There's like a lot of detail here. Um, and it's telling me when users see this flow, what happens during the flow, the order of steps that happen. That's like pretty important. If I'm going to analyze a funnel, I need to know like in what order did things happen? and then if there is a success event like when the setup is complete and then it gives me a bunch of events that I can use to analyze it. So this is already such a gamecher like in the past I would have leaned on secondhand sources like notion uh to piece together how it was built with cursor like you were saying I can go straight to the source and have it translated into natural language and that just gives me a lot more confidence because it reflects what's actually live not what someone remembered to write down. One thing I want to call out while you're going to your next step is one of the steps that I see skipped by engineering teams is good event tracking when they release a feature because you know you you start up front in the PRD and you like define a tracking plan and then it gets to implementation and people forget should be a front-end event should it be backend event and one of my favorite follow-up AI tasks after something has been released or it's in code review is I do a quick prompt and I go is this is everything appropriately tracked in this feature >> and I get either cursor or Devon to go in and put in all the right events and make sure that the schemas are normalized. So for all the data analysts out there, be annoying and do a PR for your own uh events on new features so you're not, you know, stuck with what the engineers built for you. that inspires me to I can take the endspec and just put it into any AI tool and say what front-end events do I or what events do I need to ask for to be able to measure the success of this effectively. Um because right now I'm just doing that in my head. That is not something that I have. >> Yeah. Don't do it in your head. That's the subtitle of how I AI. How I AI. Yes. Don't do it in your head. [laughter] So uh with this next prompt um I again not the most like sophisticated prompt. I'm just saying I want to understand at a high level how this feature has been performing and I give the quick context of you know our goal is to make it better. That's pretty obvious that I just want to spell that out. And I like Tim giving a fair amount of discretion to the cursor agent. I'm saying okay come up with the ideal output fields. I have some ideas but like you know it's up to you. And then two I do find that telling it explicitly to create a file. It sometimes forgets to do that and just writes the SQL directly in the um conversation sidebar. Uh use the MCP connection. Like I went through all this trouble to set it up. Uh I want it to use the Snowflake MCP connection and then actually QA the file. And that's what's so powerful about this cursor agent and the snowflake MCP is not only is it writing the SQL, which is what chatgbt has been doing for me for the last year, it is running it, looking at the output and then making like its own sniff test sense check decisions which is just so cool. Okay. Okay. And then another thing I want to call out as we are running this, the reason why I have a fair amount of confidence that this is going to work relatively quickly is because I and our data team have done a fair amount of work to create what's called a semantic layer. And so uh first our amazing data engineering team like six months ago decided we were going to create like a general company semantic layer. And a semantic layer is essentially just a translation for an LLM of like our business terms, tables, fields, filters, metrics, etc. And AI can look at those files and understand like what our tables mean. This general one covered like our mostused generic tables, orders, items, users, etc. Um, and so they connected it to a custom GPT and anyone in the company can go ask pretty basic questions like what was the average order size in Europe last year and get an answer really quickly. And so that's been a huge unlock to save our analytics team time of like we're not answering these questions for people. They can self-s serve. It's just democratizing data and you know saving us a lot of time so that we can focus on more deep analysis. And for deeper analysis like we needed something more than just these basic tables. And so I with a lot of help from one of our data engineers she built a specialized semantic layer just for like my scope as a test. I was you know we're the I was the first one in the company to do this but we're planning on kind of rolling it out to all of the areas of scope. And you know basically this semantic layer just defines the tables that I use the most. joins the filters, the metrics, and because it lives in our codebase, it's like in our data science repo, cursor can just tap into it, and it just makes the zeroot ability like insane of running SQL. I've seen a couple of these and yeah, I don't know what yours looks like, but they really just look like defined terms tables. This table means this, this field means that. If you're trying to query average order value, this is how you do it. And it's almost your documentation in a little bit more of a structured form around common queries. And what I think is nice about this is its ability to be managed by code. You can change it, you can update it, you can add new things. I also think for the data engineers out there, it reduces a little bit of needed complexity on the data warehouse setup because previously you were creating these like aggregate tables and these like defined metrics and you're hoping people were writing queries the right way and now you can deci define these canonical queries and know that no matter kind of like what your tables look like, they're going to get to to the right answer, which I think is quite nice on the data engineering side. >> Yeah. So this is an example of like what you were talking about. It's just a very structured JSON file. And from what I understand, I did not do this, but I had the engineer explain the process to me. And honestly, LLM's helped a lot with creating this. You know, he fed in details about our data warehouse and just a million queries that I had previously written and it kind of helped spit out this type of thing. He also used lang chain to like change the names of a bunch of the reports that we had into question form because obviously when I'm querying this whether it's through a custom GPT or cursor I'm often asking a question and so I thought that was pretty cool like translating it to a question makes the semantic layer work so much better. >> Oh this is going to be my next project. This is so fun. >> Oh amazing glad to inspire. So to go back to the actual SQL that was run and I will actually just run this. See hopefully this and just in case people missed this you did call out the Snowflake MCP which was what we're seeing right now which is a programmatic way to hook into running queries in your Snowflake data warehouse. So you can not only generate the SQL here, but instead of like copy and pasting it and going to like Snowflake Cloud and running it or whatever your visualization tool is, you can just run it right here. You're getting your tables right here. So again, like you're you're eliminating that context switching, you're eliminating the copy and paste, and you're getting your data right here. Yep. Exactly. And so I am Oh, this is interesting. This actually I am looking at this and it's I think it showed a mistake. Um but you know, I asked it to queue. QA itself. Normally this has done does a very good job. But one of the quick QAs that I do for something like this is I want to see no skip steps. Oh, actually you know what I remember from the context this is a temporary um >> this is a step that only some people see. But usually when I'm looking through this, you know, in a in if we were not doing this demo, I would spend probably a lot longer QAing this. But I just want to see drop off that makes sense, right? like I don't want to see 0 0 and then one or then zero and so that's just a quick QA that I can do you know it's not the AI's name on this analysis it's mine so I do that the other thing that I have done to really make sure that I can QA this effectively is I in my cursor rules I tell it to comment every single CTE so that I know what the and sorry CTE are like sections of SQL that often are created when you're writing SQL and I just want to know each step of what is happening so that as I'm looking at the SQL I can say okay the agent said it's doing this and like looking at this code I can actually tell that it's doing this so engineers cover your ears because engineers hate hate hate hate hate when I say this they hate it I love over commented AI code and let me tell you why because when you are not writing this code you really need to understand the thought process behind how the code was designed and having AI comment the code that it writes gives you a natural language way to understand if your understanding of the implementation matches the actual technical implementation of the code itself based on the AI's own reasoning fine delete it if you want to I don't care I know all the arguments against over commented code and I think there's a lot of benefits for human review and it's also great context for AI when they go back and work on it. So engineers, you can now uncover your ears. You can yell at me on Twitter if you want to or an X if you want to. But I do the same thing where I say go ahead and comment in the code so I can understand how you've decomposed these step by step. Yeah, it's pretty pretty awesome. It's also I even have a custom GPT in chat GPT to comment code I've written before. I just insert code and then, you know, if I'm ever handing off dashboards to someone, I really don't want anyone to be so confused that they have to bother me. You know, my goal is to have it be quite self-s served. Look, those lines of code are not going to expand themselves. Let's get some comments. [laughter] >> This episode is brought to you by Brex. [music] If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical [music] ways. Brex is bringing that same power to finance. Brex is the intelligent finance platform built for founders. [music] With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards [music] are issues, expenses are filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add B's banking solution with a high yield treasury account, and you've got a system that helps you spend smarter, move faster, and scale [music] with confidence. One in three startups in the US already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com/how I AI. So I'm going to kick off my next my next prompt. Uh but basically like we're going to skip ahead a couple hours here because um up until this point like my goal was to get this kind of clean base query that I could use for dashboards in mode which is fair's BI tool. You know, a lot of what we are doing as the strategy and analytics team is creating creating tables that then can be used for pretty charts to tell a story. And so let's pretend that I spent a few hours with cursor like refining queries. I actually did one for the old flow and the new flow. I actually did do this. This is also a real use case like Tims. Um and then I built some visualizations in mode. What's really cool is that there is actually a modem MCP and I can tell it to view a dashboard directly. For those who are listening here, we have on the old on the left hand side our legacy flow and on the right hand side our new flow. Um you'll see that there's one step that is only present in some of the uh some of the entry points. is a split by entry point and basically it's just showing you know like what is the overall success rate and success rate by step for each of these flows and so this is what I have pointed the mode MCP towards um in this in this prompt so if we go back to this prompt and I'm just going to tell it to run this tool. Okay. So, I'm telling it again like, hey, go look at this mode dashboard and use this MCP. I also give it the direct SQL that's um that I wrote with cursor uh that's powering that dashboard. I'm just asking it for some detailed takeaways and next steps. I give it a little bit of context. Um and I tell it to ask clarifying questions and use the MCPS if necessary. The MCPS, I think I'm not sure if we've defined it yet, but model context protocol, I believe is what it stands for, are like so powerful. I think that that's when this has felt like magic the most. Like at first I assumed that they were similar to APIs where everything needs to be defined. Like some engineer on, you know, both sides needs to go define endpoints that there's a very specific structure. It seemed like a lot of work. these models just like know what to do. It's just wild to me. Um I will say that there's a lot of work on our data engineering side to get some of these MCPs set up. So I think Ben on our analytics platform team has just spent a lot of time on this. Like I I don't want to minimize that step, but as the end user of them, it is like it just feels magical every time it can just access something. And so if we go into the results over here, um, next key takeaways and next steps. Cool. So, uh, we looks like we did a good job. Yay. Fair. Um, and it gives like a pretty detailed, um, list of, you know, the funnel analysis, insights and concerns, actionable next steps, etc. Like this is already a pretty good sort of output to start with. Um, but at the end of the day like analysis like this only matters if you can communicate it clearly, right? Like you need to sort of convince people of whatever you are trying to communicate. So we also have a notion MCP and I'm going to ask cursor to create a doc that captures our findings in a structured way. And I want to pause really quickly because we have done this in maybe 15 minutes where you have taken a problem kind of like a pre and post analysis of a feature change. You have written SQL. You have not used a Wizzywig analytics tool. You have written straight up good SQL traceable SQL to do a funnel analysis of that on a daily basis. Very interesting. You have made a dashboard for it so that your business users can use it. You have then done a metaanalysis of that dashboard using um the MCP to actually read the dashboard, do a first pass analysis, create a summary not only of the results but of recommended next steps and then you are going to publish that to your business using notion. Now I have to say I have worked with a lot of data teams and most of them spending their time saying what is the priority of this analysis? we have a backlog. I need data engineering and fine, here's the dashboard. Like it's like the ones that like get promoted three times in a year that go that extra step where they're like, \"And here's the analysis and here are my recommended next steps and I made it pretty so you can share it with your boss.\" And I just think like I was watching this and I was like, \"Oh man, I'm going to promote this data analyst.\" Like they're pretty they're pretty they're pretty good. And so I just think the ability to level up the quality of your work and think through the interesting things. The interesting thing isn't like did I write this SQL join correctly, right? >> The interesting thing is like have I thought through all the edge cases? Do I have any creative ideas on what we could do next? Can we improve this analysis for the future? And so I really like this endto-end flow because it just shows how you are leveraging up into higher strategic tasks um as opposed to spending your time sort of in the tactics. Yeah, I mean it's I totally agree and we are almost done but um like you said you know we need to we need to communicate this and so one thing that we have done on strategy and analytics is um our chief strategy officer Dan like he really cares about synthesized writing and all the leaders on his team care about synthesized writing and so we worked with him a couple months ago to actually create some guidance on how to write at fair like fair is very much a vertical dock culture you know pre-eread culture. We're not creating a lot of sides. We are writing a lot of docs. And so we have this sort of like use answer for structure key principles doc. And then we also have a template for what docs should look like. And so actually in this prompt you'll see like I tell it to follow these um to follow these rules that are in these docs. And that's like another thing I love about SQL or sorry about cursor is you can just tell it what rules to follow in a variety of ways. >> Okay, Alexa, I'm going to give you an upgrade here which is you should reference these files in your cursor rules so you don't have to answer. >> That's that's a great I should I mean I wanted to you know show the full flow but um the reason I don't is because it would have actually done it in the previous step. >> Oh yeah >> because it would it would have it would have known and then I wouldn't have gotten to talk about it. I will I will do that once we are done. >> It's showbiz folks. That's what this is. >> Um and so the last thing is I am going to pull over the doc. Uh this is one I created from a previous time I did this just because I wanted to highlight in yellow. Um I gave instructions in this prompt to tell me what to add. I think one thing I want to get across is this. I don't think that cursor yet or AI can zero shot like a executive ready doc yet. Like there's that is where I think that we still need to do three to four revs of um of sort of editing, adding analysis, making sure this makes sense. Like these tools have so much context, but we have we still have some context that is just this like janiqua like humans are still valuable. And so this is like a pretty good start. And I think what's cool about cursor is like I cut out some of the middlemen. I got to this point like really really quickly, but we're not just creating like AI slop docs all over the place. We are, you know, just accelerating how fast analysts can do things like this. We, you know, and the other thing that's really helpful about um I would run this through that guidance three or four times. Um, it can be hard when you've been so in the weeds of an analysis to like take a step back and make sure your story makes sense. And so that's what LLMs are really good for. Um, so it can like cover my blind spots. >> Well, you know what's more painful than running this three times through your guidance is sitting three times with your SVP of strategy and having them tell you this makes no sense and you need to go back and edit stuff. So again, I think uh what a what a nicer way to get to a higher quality output than uh yes >> than having to >> it saves me time and it saves the leaders on my team time and hopefully improves the quality you know it's fundamentally >> improving how you know we are doing work on analytics team >> and one thing I want to call out for folks that are maybe listening and not watching is Alexa my friend here is smiling this is fun this is like interesting And it's fun. You're not sitting here saying, \"I have no role to play anymore. The machines are going to take over.\" You're saying, \"Man, it was really boring to like dig through tables and write all this SQL that I know how to write and I've done it a couple times, so let's let the machines do it.\" And now you're able to focus on interfacing with the business, having impact. Um, and it's just I I think it's fun. Every time I get in these tools, I feel like it's magical. I feel like it's really fun. And so I want to call out we got smiles across the board here on how I AI. >> I didn't show this but the type ahead like if when you're actually editing the SQL that's also so fun. It's just fun. It knows what you want to do. Um so yeah this this whole process is very fun. >> I think what's so powerful this is not just like making the good analyst just incredible. It's also democratizing data. So this is something that can be done. SQL can be written by people all over our business whether we're in sales designers anyone else can write this. So the people with the context can do analysis just like this and then the analysts can do the really complicated stuff where these tools could help them get really into the weeds. >> For people early in their career, I've said this before and I mean it to be true. If you want to know the inflection point of Claro's career, it is when she learned SQL. Um tr I mean truly I became unstoppable at that point. And so lowering the barrier to entry on data analysis is just going to create a whole bunch of really high high impact folks. >> Awesome. Okay, Alexa. So, we just saw how cursor can do endto-end funnel analysis all the way to the proverbial front door of your SVP strategy. Tim, let's talk about another kind of analysis, which is experimentation analysis. My favorite. >> Yeah, you should close to your heart. So, look, we've talked about the big picture. We've talked about like a really detailed sort of actual analyst of how they do their day job. But I think one of the other things these AI tools are just so good is just accelerating process like automating away some of those routine lower impact steps in the analytics journey. And so as a good example we want to show you a quick agent we built which automates the process of writing up experiment results. So across fair we might be running I don't know hundreds of AB tests on the product a month and each of those experiments needs to be monitored assessed documented and that just takes up so much time for our analysts. So if we don't stay on top of this very quickly it's our team that can become the bottleneck and slow down our launch velocity which is the last thing anyone wants. And I know this is something that's happening up and down the country around every single tech company. Um so we thought it'd be a good example just to to demonstrate. So um let me show you how I built this. Uh, one thing I want to really really stress here is just how straightforward these things are to build. Like once you've gone through the pain of setting up cursor, getting your MCPs in place, actually spinning up any new agent you can think about is just so quick and so non-technical for anyone to do. So it all runs off a cursor rules file. So if you don't know what these are, they're literally just a type of file, uh, an MDC file that these agents know to look for and know they're likely to contain instructions. um they're really easy to set up. It's basically plain English. So you just write uh a simple uh oneline uh entry of what it is. So format for writing experiment results using EPO data. EPO is just the uh experiment tool that we use. It's basically takes our data, does a bit of analysis, slaps a UI around it, uh and and writes it up for us. Um uh so you then select when you want to apply. I've just selected apply intelligent. I trust the model to work out when it needs to use it. They do a pretty good job. And then other than that, it literally is just writing out what you want the agent to do. Now, this might look a bit complicated. And I'll generally write this in a few minutes in plain text what I wanted to write. I'll ask cursor to then tear the thing down and I'll rewrite it a couple of times and just get it right in the format I want. But ultimately, it's just a step-by-step guide of what I want this thing to do. So, I've just said for those who are listening, I've said if you're asked to write up experiment results, do the following things. So ask the experiment name if you haven't already got it and then go collect the data you're going to need. Uh so use the EPO MCP we've set up. So go talk to our experiment space, pull in the actual results of the experiment and then use our notion MCP that we've already talked about to go pull in all the other context that you might need. So any other documentation that's going to help it interpret that data and write up this report. And then I've got a little bit down here you can see telling it exactly what kinds of um of documents to look for. So, PRDS, experiment docs, technical specifications, that's that's what it's going to help it look for. And then I ask it to basically write out those results in the format I give it. And then I'm pretty prescriptive about the format I want because I want this to do it really consistently in the format we want with really tight um tight takeaways. So, actually, I've asked it to create it in just a local file on my cursor on my computer. And that just means I can actually look at it before it goes create to the notion docs. I can take a peek, refine the prompt if I need to, but that's just a fallback. And then ultimately, it's going to turn into another notion doc so everyone else in the business can see it. And it's going to do all this incredibly quickly. And let's actually just see what this thing looks like in in reality. So let's just run it on uh an experiment result. So I've just said, please write up the experiment results for and I've given it the name of the experiment, which is vertical product tile images. Uh and straight off it's gone off and it's found uh it's written off a nice to-do list. It's found the EPO result. So, it's just called the results. It's found its results. Great. It's found the the rules. And now it's going to start working this all out for me, which is great to see. And then while it's doing all that, we'll just have a look. So, the format we've gone through, uh, we can just show here. So, basically, the rest of this is all just showing exactly what the format this thing is going to look like. So, I've asked it to give me the document links, exactly, uh, what I want. So, if I click into more context, a brief summary of the experiment, uh, and then the key bit, the actual metrics that it's got from EPO. So, it's going to show me the actual results, the confidence intervals. It's going to pull out the most important ones, and it will give me a nice little color coding for it. Uh, and then I just want the actual answer from this. So, I actually want it to do the work of interpreting what we should do next. And so, it's written the takeaway section. So, I want a clear, should we roll this out? Should we roll it back? What should we do? And give me the reasons why, like, why are we doing this? And are there any other interesting insights that you found uh that we should call out from this? So, let's see. Right. So, it's look, let's have a look at what it's doing here. It has found everything we need. It's starting to write out the dock, which is nice to see. Uh, in this little thing, I'm just going to go ahead and queue up. So, turn this into a notion. So, as soon as I've run it, while we look at the actual results, uh, it will start writing the notion doc. And let's have a look. So, straight away in a second while it's running that, I have got a write up with all the right context I need. So, it's got the links I needed. It's got the context. It's pulled the right data. Good. The nice thing is this results. So, this was just literally sharing uh vertical images rather than square images like a really standard growth experiment like which one performs better. And you can see a nice stat lift uh of about 3 and a half% uh for the treatment. Uh and then it's pulled out some other interesting business max. And let's have a look at these takeaways. So, it's saying uh great roll it out. the right answer uh because of that lift and it's also pulled out some interesting things. So it said our data science prediction models are also actually positive. So it's saying not only have we got more retailers actually higher quality retailers the ones we've got. So this looked good as a first pass. This looks great. And just to call out one thing here personally, like we we have a standard format for doing these where you have to type the confidence interval and type the emojis. And that is like work that is not valuable for our team. And so it's pretty awesome that like it came up with takeaways, but it also saved us five minutes of like fiddling around with emojis and decimal points. >> Yeah. I mean AI as a translation layer between a SAS interface or a SQL query into natural language in the format that you like that your boss likes. That's just a timesaver in and of it of itself. So I I love using AI as like the universal format translator. >> So as you can see I've just asked the notion link. It should produce the notion. So let's just open that up and let's put it on the screen. And look, straight away I've got a nice uh document I can share around with everyone with all the right color codes, the takeaways, and even as a little bonus, let's see, it's done. It always has trouble getting things in a little toggle. But right at the bottom here, I've even asked it to spit out a slack with an even more summarized version. So I can just drop this into the right review channels and straight away this can go and get approved. Now, are we going to do this for every complicated experiment? Probably not. There might need to be a bit of analysis, but for the simple ones, straight one shot. Even the complicated ones, this accelerates you. But also anyone in the business can start doing this, which means we can pass more and more of these things down to engineers, PMs, other people to write this kind of stuff and do the analysis for them, which again can just massively accelerate our launch velocity affair, which we're really excited for. >> Yeah, I I'm sorry. And I know this is my brand, but I feel like AI is just acrewing to every task. Sorry, PM, it's your job now. [laughter] So, uh I I do like that that little trend that's happening. This is amazing. Um, love it. Have done these kinds of analyses before. They have not been this easy to read and they certainly haven't been generated in 90 seconds. Really useful tool for experimentation analysis. A call out to the experimentation tools out there that I know and love. Um, if you have not made an MCP for access to your data, you are limiting your customers. And so I do think sort of AI integration of SAS tools is going to be a way that teams start to evaluate the quality of tools that they're working with. So, just something to think about if you're out there building data analysis tools. Okay, we are going to wrap up very quickly with a final we're going to do a bonus. We usually only do three use cases, but your yours are all so good. We're going to do a speedrun through a bonus use case, which is actually designing and analyzing kind of unstructured data in a user survey. So, Tim, you're going to whip us through how you could use AI to make surveys and survey analysis a lot better. >> Yeah, I'm going to do this really quickly. We're not going to spend time on this, but um let's just show I think it's just another one of those incredibly common analytics use cases that everyone has to do and they are just so timeconuming. You've got to design the survey correctly, code it into a survey platform, then analyze all those results. It's really timeconuming. But end to end AI can just like transform the whole process. Let's show another one. I'm just going to stop. I'm not going to run these. I'm just going to go straight to my backup. So, let's just start on design. So, what I love doing this, I think you can do it on curs, you can do it on many things. I think chat g projects is really good for this and again incredibly accessible. Everyone knows how these work. Uh it's just a great way of giving context. So if we switch over to this one, which chat fat, it's lovely and taking a bit of time to load. You can see in files, what I did was give it a bit of background information. So what is our bit of business? So this was a survey we want to design on fair direct tools. So that's our tools that we give all our brands to help them accelerate their sales with their own customers. And so I've given a ton of information to the model that just says like what actually is fair direct? What are these tools? what's the strategy and then I whenever I do a survey like this um whether I'm doing AI or not I'll start with hypothesis that that's ultimately what you want to test and so this is nice if I just open up those hypothesis so this is what I fed it into I just gave it a list of simple hypotheses on what um what we want to learn we do aligned we got everyone aligned on some hypothesis there's 14 in here and they're really simp I'll just call out one like um higher sales on fair leads to u more usage of these tools um things like that that we asked now I've just given that into it and all I did if I just look at this prompt that we ran so this was a simple prompt all I did was drop it in saying you're a you're a specialist at doing these customer insight surveys run design me a 10-minute survey for the thousand brands to test those hypotheses I said these are the inputs I've given you here's a bit of design requirements that we want and I asked her three things I said turn those hypotheses into a full questionnaire that we can ask our customers, but also don't just do that. Give me the coding file that turns that questionnaire into the actual, in this case, Qualrix, the platform we use to actually run these things. Can actually design that straight away in one click and give me an analysis plan for some what to do with it. >> I have to pause you really quickly cuz this whole episode has been Tim saying, \"I just did this really simple prompt and then you see this like 1,000word hyper ststructured, very organized prompt.\" And Alexa is like, \"Oh man, I would just go in there and be like, \"Maybe a nice survey, please.\" [laughter] [gasps] >> I love it. So, I'm a big believer that 99% of my problems are going to be one line. And then if I'm going to send a model, a big model is to go do work for 15 minutes. I'll probably ask another model just to turn my one line into something more more detailed. >> I want I want the AB test of Alexa, you run this exact same GBT with a tinier prompt, and you tell me if you get the same quality. See what happens. See what happens. Baby, I'm just I don't trust it quite as much as Alexa does just yet. Okay. So, what do we get from that? So, very quickly from a list of hypotheses, I've got straight away a really nice first pass of a survey. Now, it's going to ask a load of questions. It's about the right length. Like, this can just massively accelerate the process. And then once we've got that right, it's also given me that coding file, which I'll just scroll on screen. These things are painful to write. So just having this a oneliner to tell exactly how the system should prompt this and write it out is just like saves hours of time for our research operations team. And it even then translates that into an analysis plan that says this is what the outputs from that are going to look like. So straight away this whole thing can go from a list of hypotheses into something we could probably get out to our customers by the end of the day. Now that's like shortens this enormously. But what happens when you get the results back? That's the other thing this can do. And so again, I'll do this incredibly quickly and just show you the final result, but I did a very similar prompt as well. So all I did, I'm going to show you the file I dropped into this just show you how painful this is. So I just gave the same hypothesis and look how bad this like it's the raw output from Qualrix. Like these usually take a lot of cleaning. It's one line for every respondent and then one column not just for every question but for every possible answer to every question. So these things are incredibly dense. uh for anyone's worth them and they take a bit of time, a bit of playing with. So the only other thing I gave it was a a sort of helper file which was basically that u sort of coding file that I just showed you. So it's the what's the question ID, what's the question language, what's the answers and then is it I just add these two columns which is like is it a demographic question or an answer and is it a single choice or is it a multiple choice? That's all I gave it. And then I've written another one of my uh fun and simple prompts. Um so uh same roll task here just analyze the survey results give find the right most interesting things in this data and then judge the predefined hypothesis. Um uh so I want a table that basically says like for those hypothesis was it right or was it wrong. Uh and then again I always end on little qu check. I don't want it to go away 15 minutes before uh and come back with something that isn't very useful. And let's have a look at this just very quickly. So, I've got a nice little summary out front. And then there are my 14 hypothesis. >> Oh, >> and it's got a nice table that says proved, neutral, disproved for each of them. And it's even because I asked it to, giving me a nice confidence score. So, I said one, it's really confident in this five. It's not very confident at all. And you can kind of see the different levels throughout this. And then beneath it, I've got for each of these actually the specific analysis that I asked to do. So, just throw all the insights I found to back up those findings. So, like, is this the only analysis we're going to do on this survey? Like, almost certainly not. But day one, I've got the results. I've thrown it into this and within a matter of minutes, I've got a much much better intuition of what all that day is showing. So, while I might go and do some analysis on this, I can be so much more targeted on exactly what we want to what we want to look into and where I want to spend my time. Uh, and straight away, we can start sort of sharing some of these findings out with people very very quickly. >> Oh, no. So at I'm reflecting now after this episode like okay I've told everybody to ship a bunch of features and now I'm going to be like do a bunch of analysis [laughter] like in my mind I'm like oh my gosh I'm underusing AI to actually understand my business and it's so accessible and if I can just write 17 point prompts like Tim I can get really high quality insights. But I do want to call out uh just reflecting on this whole episode in your four workflows. What I love about what you're showing us is so many people think that AI is an input to producing a thing, but haven't done that that full circle back to analyzing the thing, sharing the thing, communicating about the thing. And I think you're showing both sides. You can create with AI and you can analyze and communicate with AI. And I think looking at both sides of that coin is really useful. Okay, we are going to do the one and only lightning round question because we have gotten long on this episode and I want to get you all back to all of your agents and MCPs and analysis. We're going to go back to prompts one last time. We're going to figure out your personality around prompts. Alexa, Tim, when AI is not listening, when your NCP will not call the tool, what is your prompting technique? Alexa, what do you do? I think mine's pretty straightforward where I think the problem that I run into most frequently is that I'm clearly running out of context. Like a conversation has gone so long that it's starting to be wonky. And so while I think you know level one is just starting over, uh what AI is best at is summarizing. So, I'll say, \"Hey, summarize like what we've done so far in this, you know, 30 turn conversation and then use that to start over.\" Um, because you know, like, like I've heard other episodes people say, \"You want to figure out like where it got off track.\" Clearly, I'm a pretty efficient person. I don't, you know, I'm not Tim. I'm not like writing out the entire prompt for 20 minutes. Like, I don't have time for that. I just want to say, \"Hey, summarize what happened. We're going to start over, but I'm going to give it that summary.\" So at least the new conversation can get some context from the old. >> Great. And Tim, what about you? >> So much state for my prompts. It's all AI. It's all AI. What my work chat did?

    "transcript": "Welcome to a spooky and unplanned Halloween edition of How I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you use LLMs to do spooky stuff for your kids. Today we had a haunted episode recording that we couldn't get to work. So instead of our regular scheduled programming, we did a quick Halloween vibe code that I think some of you parents out there will be inspired by. If you have other Halloween vibe codes, please share them with us in the comments and enjoy this very short episode of How I AI Halloween Edition. Marco, we may we may not be able to do our podcast today. We are haunted >> by >> expired expired corporate credit cards, but you have a a Halloweenbased AI use case we're going to talk about instead just for a few minutes before we >> res. I do. And maybe I'll I'll kind of do it live on the fly here. >> Yes. >> And so why don't we why don't we not just talk about it, why don't we actually do it. So I'm dressed as Captain Peicard right now. Uh as I do every year dressed as Captain Peicard. I mean, it naturally fits with my, you know, >> and stuff like that. Of course, I am a huge Star Trek fan. I'm in the middle of Strange New Worlds right now, season 4, >> but uh by night, at least for Halloween, I do something a little bit different. I am the block fortune teller. So, this is the Halloween party block that I live on here in Pedmont, California. And so, we will block off the street and all of our neighbors do crazy stuff. And so, you know, my neighbor across the street is going to have all this projection stuff going on and they have like fire coming out of something and but what I do well I am a fortune teller. So, traditionally uh what I have done for the past few years is that I have pre-created fortunes. So, I set up this table and on this table uh I have a a crystal ball and the crystal ball glows and stuff like that. It's not a high-tech crystal ball. has nothing but a couple of LED lights in it. But the kids come up and there's lots of kids in town, you know, hundreds of them really come up and they they will get their fortunes from this thing. Now, in reality, what I did was I in the past had precreated these fortunes. So, I make a list of them with GPT3 and then GPT4 and I store them in a note on my phone and I kind of keep it between my legs under the table and I'll kind of pick one at random. So, when a kid comes up, I'll pick this one and I make kind of kid-friendly fortunes. Now, this year, I was thinking about doing this, and since we're talking, I'm gonna do this live now. I'm gonna actually do this live. I'm gonna let me give you >> We're gonna Are you gonna read my fortune? >> Uh, we're gonna we're going to make a fortune for you. Yeah. >> Yes. >> So, I think that for this now, there's lots of tools that I can use to do this. I can use Lovable. I can use Bolt. I can use Vzero. I'm going to use GitHub Spark for this one. >> Was not expecting a GitHub Spark today on Halloween, so this is exciting for me. >> How about that? Okay. So I'm going to say make a mobile app which when I click a button generates a new fortune in the context of a fortune teller. Okay. Uh I don't think I need to tell it much more than that. It's probably going to kind of work on the first try. Well, we'll see. Let's see what this does. Now you know in other circumstances I have sometimes given it like a list of things to scroll between. You might have seen on the screen that earlier I had a chemistry ion flashcards app. My daughter uh is in honors chemistry and she was at the time studying polyatomic ions uh chlorate perchlorate you know sulfate stuff like that. And uh she needed to memorize the name to the the formula of these poly ions. And so I made a flashc cards app with this thing which actually worked really well. I mean I just gave it basically the list of the polyatomic ions and it totally freaking did it in this kind of flash card interface that worked on the phone and so that was pretty nice. That's kind of one of the reasons why I decided to go with GitHub Spark for this one is because I know that kind of worked for me before and in a way you could look at this as kind of being a flashc card app too. It's going to kind of make these flash cards of fortunes I guess. >> Um >> oh my gosh. Well, I I have a block party tomorrow, so I might steal your idea. >> You could do this. >> Definitely pass for a fortune teller as well, you know. >> Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay, so this is going to Oh, it made a PRD. That's, you know, I loved. Let's see. Can we see it? Let's see if we can see what it's doing while it's doing it. Oh, it does. Okay. So, wow. It's really It's going fast and furious over here. So, it's it's totally writing this PRD over here. And now it's it's made a page index. So it's starting to make the actual HTML. So it's it's going to write this in HTML and you know this is this is common and now it's got some CSS. So it's going to style uh the page. Uh but I mean this is this is vibe coding or anyway front-end vibe coding as we do it today. Uh now in reality though I mean when I'm doing real vibe coding uh projects and while this thing is working since I actually already have this on my screen I'm going to bust this out over here. Now, if I'm doing a real project, like a serious project, not just a little fortune teller app nowadays, I will 100% use specit. Uh I absolutely do use spec kit. In fact, it so happens I was earlier today working on just such a project. So, I am by the way, I'm VB products of corei at Microsoft. However, uh I do come from an engineering background and I still code pretty much every day something. So, I'm working on this project and in this project uh where I did use spec kit. So here like this is a full feature specification that I'm working on. I have this whole agent thing that I'm I'm working on and uh I am adding this ability to give user feedback. So this agent will like fill out a questionnaire for me and that's cool but I want to be able to pick a a cell a question and be like no no no you did that wrong fix it. And then the agent should just wake up and do it when you use spec kit. And so like this is the proper way to write a spec. Uh when you use spec kit it does this stuff over here. So you see what it's going to do. it throws these questions at me. So, it's like, wait a minute, how long should the feedback be? What if the user gives you like a ton of feedback? Then what do I do? And it it'll it'll lob all of these questions at me while it does this. So, spec kit is cool. It's totally free. It works with like in this case I'm using it with GitHub profil, but it works with FOD code and it works with cursor and all these other things. So, that is super cool. Uh, I love it. It helps you write a better spec. Uh, but >> oh, look at this. >> My app is here. Okay. Tap to reveal your fortune, the cosmos. >> Okay, >> I'm very [clears throat] excited about this. >> Wow. Okay, >> that's a little bit too uh >> let me let me read this for people that are not on video. In the tapestry of the cosmos, the stars weave a path illuminated by your dreams. Trust in their guiding light. Now, what I like about this is it is completely ambiguous and means nothing. Excellent. excellent fortune, but I bet you want it to be a little more fun and kids friendly for for your use case. >> And so over here on the left hand side, you can see that I'm saying make each fortune only one sentence and make it kid-friendly. So now I'm going to kind of prompt my way towards doing something and it's starting to generate again. So I mean I mean you got to admit though, I mean it's pretty freaking good on the first try. >> Really good. You know what? I haven't seen um this GitHub Spark uh done live, but the design is actually really cute. So, so often in these vibe coding tools, you get these incredibly boring designs, but that is actually quite quite lovely. Okay. >> All right. Did we get it? >> It's done. It says it's done. So, here we go. Let's see what happens. >> Mystic Oracle, what is my fortune? When you sprinkle kindness like fairy dust, the whole world transforms into a playground of magical adventures and shimmering smiles. >> That's it. Is that is lovely and kid-friendly. >> Still maybe a little bit on the big words there. I mean, I can >> And on the abstract side, >> yeah, on the abstract side, I mean, uh, let's see. Make the fortunes a little more concrete >> and and let's make them a little more fun >> and maybe a little more humorous. >> Yeah. try not to use such big words. I mean, a lot of times like the kids that'll come up to my fortuneelling booth, they'll be like, you know, two or three years old, you know? >> Yeah. Yeah. >> And for them sometimes I'll like not even use my little app thing and I'll be like, >> \"You're going to try a new food today and it's going to be yummy.\" [laughter] And their parents will be like, \"Thank you.\" Like >> your candy in your Halloween bag will multiply. But I mean, you know, Peepon is a small town and I actually know a lot of these parents and stuff like that. Sometimes they come back at me later and they're like, \"You told my kid this fortune.\" Like I told one kid a fortune once and it was like, \"You're going to make a new friend today.\" Which actually did come from my my the previous version of this uh generation. >> And uh she said he was talking about it for the whole next day. She was like, \"The fortune teller said, \"I'm going to make a friend today. Like this is going to be cool.\" >> Well, your kid's 15. Should I uh tell her she's going to get a car in her future? >> [laughter] >> Now, okay, now now we're going off the rails here. Okay, here we go. You ready? Here's your This is This one's for you, Claire. Okay, ready? >> This week, you will find a shiny rock that looks like a slice of pizza and makes everyone giggle when you >> like that. That would entertain my six-year-old. >> I mean, that is very concrete for sure. And now, you know, your six-year-old Yeah. would totally be looking for, oh, where's that rock that looks like the slice of pizza? I'm gonna find it. >> That's exactly right. Okay. I >> One more. >> One more. Let's see. One more. This week we're Okay, again with the rock and maybe it's going a little over much on the rocks here. You recover a rock that looks like a cupcake. Sprinkles of that. I mean, this is why you you got to like integration test these things. Are these all rocks? Oh no. Today a fluffy squirrel will steal your snack, but then share a secret about the best hiding spots in the park. Okay. >> I'm surprised the squirrel is not sharing the secret about the best rocks in the park. [laughter] So, I mean, >> you got it. Okay. I um you know, it's it's Halloween. It's almost 11:00 a.m. I've got my block party is tomorrow. So, we're blocking off the street. We're doing a posth Halloween. Everybody bring your candy so you can give it all more away party. And I'm gonna do this. I'm going to hook it up to voice. >> Sweet. give it like a spooky fortune teller voice and uh set it up out front. Well, Marco, despite our haunted podcast episode, we will get you back on to actually talk about Spectrian development, but thank you for doing our first and maybe an annual tradition of our Halloween AI how I AI episode. Thank you for showing this. >> Every year we'll have like different elements to Halloween every year. >> Perfect. Well, we'll get you back on on the pod soon. And I think I'm going to just I'm going to go cut this and and share it. >> Thanks so much for watching.

We actually haven't seen anybody yet just using cursor to write and that's what you're doing. >> The reason why cursor is my favorite UI for the AI is it has all the interfaces and interactions and connections into the tools that are critical for my daily product management.

So any system that if it feels like it's locking that contents or data away, I'm not going to prefer to use that system. I don't care why you have these modes. I'm sure there's a good reason, but that's my content and I want all my systems to be able to access it when it needs to. It's really improving communication. I'm reducing the time I'm spending writing status and at the same time improving the status content that is being circulated both up to leadership and across the organization. [music] Welcome back to how I AI. I'm Clarvo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today we have a fun conversation with Dennis Yang, [music] principal product manager for Generative AI at Chime. Now, this one makes me sweat a little bit because I thought I was the alpha AI powered PM and Dennis shows me his workflows which are way beyond anything I've seen before. He's going to show you how to use cursor to not only write your PRDs, but push them into Confluence or notion, read comments, reply to comments, prototype AI tools, and [music] more. This is a awesome one for anyone out there who's curious if you can make use of cursor without writing code. And I think you're going to learn a lot. Let's get to it. AI is supposed to make work easier, but I've been there. weeks of setup, endless back and forth with engineering, and [music] yet another tool the team never really adopts. That's why I use Zapier's AI orchestration platform. It connects with nearly 8,000 apps so I can finally put AI to work without the drama, without the delays, and without pulling engineering in every time I want to automate something. With Zapier, you can roll out AI powered workflows that do real work across your whole company [music] in days, not weeks. I use Zapier every single day. It automatically responds to leads with enriched personalized data. It checks my calendar weekly and offers smarter [music] ways to manage my time. And it even drafts emails for every new request that lands in my inbox. All of that running quietly in the background so I can focus on the work that matters. [music] And Zapier's built for scale with enterprisegrade security, compliance, and governance. It's trusted by teams at Dropbox, Airbnb, Open Door, and thousands more. Go to try.zapier.com/howi. zapier.com/howi to learn more about how Zapier can bring the power of AI orchestration to your entire org. Dennis, thanks for joining how I AI. I am really excited about this episode because we've seen so many people use tools like cursor to write code, but we actually haven't seen anybody yet just using cursor to write. And that's what you're doing. um as as a product manager and somebody who's thinking about strategy all the time. So before we dive in, why cursor? Why writing? You're not writing a lick of code in here for at least this use case that we're going to see. So how did you kind of get into this flow with this AI powered IDE? >> To me, cursor, the reason why cursor is my favorite UI for the AI is a few things. It has access to all of the models that I want to try. So you know incursor you can talk to cloud you can talk to GP5 you can do deepseeer whatever um that's the first thing and then the second thing is it has access to a file system so it can write things down um and then it can have access to cursor rules which you as you use it more and more you can start to tell it how you want to do things and then the final big thing is interop it actually works with all of the different tools that I need to work with so that's through MCP it can talk to Jura and notion and Confluence um you know look at Figma all these things. So it basically not only does it have the AI the UI for the AI it has all the interfaces and interactions um and connections into the tools that are critical for my daily product management >> you know and the other thing that I would say is running on the desktop is just fast you know it's like pretty fast at doing those things as opposed you know I think we're in this real moment where there's going to be a question of are we going to start seeing more and more desktop apps for these AI powered tools just because of the performance side of things compared to Web Web is very flexible, >> but I I like cursor cuz it is it's zippy. >> So, this is this is your new hub for >> getting work done. >> This is what my screen looks like. And that's the other thing I'm noticing is that I want bigger and bigger screens, [laughter] >> right? I'm running out of space because I want my chat, right? I want my the thing that the artifact that I'm working on and then I want the file system. And then over here, I actually have the this is my my settings pane uh docked to the bottom cuz you want to make sure that it's still green, right? So I I need more screen real estate. Uh and then >> yeah, we had Lee from Cursor on recently and he walked us through the three pane kind of model of >> Cursor for those who are listening and not watching. You have your file system on the left where you're looking at what files you can work with or in context of cursor. In the middle you have your artifacts, whether those are code um code artifacts or content artifacts. On the right you tend to have your chat. >> And then something I want to call out for for people is you also have this bottom pane you can pull up and you non I was going to say me as a developer that pain for me is always the terminal. >> Uh but this is a really nice little quality of life hack that I'm going to start to use. your bottom pane in cursor is actually the tools cursor settings. So you can turn on and off MCPS which I actually do all the time and confirm that they're working. >> Yeah, exactly. So sometimes cursor will be like I can't do that thing and you look and there's like a little red dot and you got to turn it back on. So >> yeah. Well, you know what? Before we dive in, now that I'm curious and staring at your screen, would you mind sharing what >> what MCPs just generally you have turned on and then we'll go through the few that you know you you really use on a daily basis or at least in this workflow. >> Sure. Sure. So I have MCP and I have two uh that talk to Atlassian suite. So one is our Dur MCP. This is before Atlassian launched their MCP um official server um first party server. This is um another one that I can just run locally. Notion of course it talks in my notion. Figma talks to Figma if you have Figma running. Uh and then GitHub talks directly. Uh and then these two uh MCPs are I'm actually going to talk about them. I'll talk about news API which is an MCP I wrote to talk to news API. It's just an API that searches um news articles. Um and then SEM Rush is like an SEM a search engine marketing MCP that I put together as well. um using cursor to write the MCP and then you actually can use cursor to install the MCP onto itself which I love too >> AI all the way down as we say amazing okay so so you've loaded up cursor you have it set up to write documents are there any other kind of cursor setup >> steps that you've done that you think are worth calling out for folks that are using it not to code >> yeah I I think one one big thing is as you're sort of working more and more not just cursor but just LLM's a in general loves markdown right [laughter] so like I'm starting to think in more and more in markdown so I'm actually looking at something like this all day and writing in you know looking at markdown and then previewing markdown is really important to see if what it looks like because because this is actually hard to to gro right so um so one of the good good cursor settings here is I think it's yeah preview pre mark markdown preview is a setting that you can actually find inside um inside settings. So you do command comma >> markdown preview um and then here you basically want to you know automatically pre preview markdown and the extension that I'm using here if you go to settings extensions is called markdown oh there it is markdown preview enhanced so that's one I really like >> and this one will actually automatically um show in the preview pane when you click on it >> amazing >> which I absolutely of because it used to be that you had to you have to you had to know this secret code which is like command shiftv to open up the the preview but now you can just click on a markdown thing and it pops in automatically. >> Yeah, I just want to call this call this out for folks who I know everybody everybody loves markdown now. It is the year of markdown for sure >> and um markdown can be rendered in a nice in a nice way. you don't have to look at a bunch of um hash headers and weirdly formatted table content. So either by installing an extension here or using that magic uh key combo there you can get nicely formatted uh markdown right here in your cursor view. So, okay, we've done we've done the setup. We've talked about >> extensions, cursors, your PES, your MCPS. Let's actually get into how you use cursor as a hub for workflow. How you would achieve something as a product manager sort of end to end >> using cursor and these tools you've attached. >> I think it's been well established that uh LLM's AI is really good for writing PR. So you should be doing your PRD creation in whatever flow um that you want, you know, be it chat GPT or cloud or or chat PRD, right? So um and for me, I actually do a lot of my writing now that I have this all cursor set up, I I do it directly in cursor and it's working on, you know, in markdown technically and I can preview it here. But here at Chime, we actually, you know, it's not a single player company. Um, and I think that's one thing that I really want to be pushing on here is that the reason why you want to be interacting with all these other systems across, you know, not just your AI is that there are other people usually in your company that you want to be working with. So, um, we have a a ritual here at Chime, which is when PRDs are an early draft form, um, we'll share them out into our PR draft channel and then gather tons of comments. So, I work inside Cursor. I'm making my PR here. If it's in a it's in an early stage, I don't want some comments. I'll throw it into the PRD draft channel. Um I do use git to control to source control everything. But Git is not great for you know the whole company to go into and make comments. So um I actually use the um the Confluence MCP to publish both into notion and into Confluence. Um because some people love using notion, some people love using Confluence. Um so then we have let's see here. So we have here's this exact purity pushed into uh Confluence. Um I pushed it into this uh last night and and threw it into our our comments channel and already starting to get comments. [laughter] Well, what I want to what I want to call out really quickly before we go into maybe how this how this MCP actually works because I think people just like to see it >> is one, you know, we we talked about you using an IDE as basically your text editor, which is really interesting. You're not writing directly in Confluence or Google Docs or anything. You're writing in an IDE in Markdown with a nice preview. The second thing you call out that I'm curious your thoughts on is Git and source control for non-code assets or non-explicitly code assets. I think we're at this really interesting place where because these primitives are being built in the context of software engineering, you're getting these concepts of markdown, get commits, like change tracking in these tools that used to be very software engineering centric. Yes. >> And I'm curious just like let's take a minute as a as product people >> do you think we're going to bridge that gap? Do you think there's going to be like git for well maybe I should build it but like git for PMs or do you think we're still little like the abstraction is too high um for it to be useful and you need some of that UX polish that you're seeing in some of these more classic productivity tools. >> I have a lot of thoughts about this. Um so as we're sort of creating these artifacts that inform the product that we're building traditionally today these artifacts sit outside of the code base right so this prd is sitting inside confluence right here >> um but now what I'm realizing is since I'm using cursor and using git to source control this artifact it's actually now sitting inside this artifacts directory >> and what I'm wondering is that if I think I want to start to See if the artifacts are actually sitting inside the repo into which the code is being developed. That adjacency actually encourages the engineers and the AI coding assistant. >> Yep. >> To continually have access to this. They don't you don't have to give it an MCP to confluence. This is the source of truth. Um so you can read it and when things happen. So PRDS are typically a snapshot in time of this is what we thought the thing should be at this moment. Um, in development, we constantly learn and iterate and learn and iterate. Um, but rarely do we go back to the PR to edit it. So, what if I put a cursor rule in that says, \"Hey, if I'm working on this feature and it and I'm learning things about the feature as I'm working on it, remember to update the PRD with the latest of how you're thinking about this.\" >> That's that's how the chat PRD repo works. So, we have >> amazing. We have a we have a docs um directory inside our sort of like repo for chat pd. It has a combination of product documentation and engineering documentation listed there. Um even to-dos like we've even pulled some of the like just task tracking into into the repo because then you know everybody can work on it AI or our human engineers. And so we've actually moved um all of our all of our documentation PRDS technical documentation and userfacing support docs into the repo because you know when I'm working on the product I'm 90% of the time just working directly in in in the code and the code needs the context of the documentation. the documentation needs the context of the code. And so I think it'll just be really interesting to see where these source of truth content pieces lie. I mean the other thing that's kind of interesting is because you're in like a cursor or something that is a um MCP client, you could just put the link to confluence in there and then right >> it could call the MCP and look it up on this other source of truth. So you know who knows where all this data will acrue. there will be battle of the enterprise software source of truth um platforms but I just I do think there's a lot of flexibility and optionality and I do really believe just like you said code and documentation are going to start living in the same place more and more >> exactly and then that brings me to another thing that I'm really realizing is in this future the most useful solutions will have interoperability as one of the key things right so any system that if it feels like it's locking that contents or data away. I'm not going to prefer to use that system, right? Yeah. >> Like I don't care what why you have these modes. I'm sure there's a good reason, [laughter] >> but that's my content. Like, and I want all my systems to be able to access it when it needs to. >> Um, so I think that's going to be increasingly more important. Well, and what's really interesting is, you know, you've you've been in product management for a long time and B2B and we used to always say in B2B like your number one competition is like an Excel spreadsheet or a Google sheet >> completely. >> And now like your number one competition is like a source controlled markdown file. [laughter] Like if you cannot outperform the source controlled markdown file as a a as a SAS offering, then you're not adding enough value. So I think it's going to be really interesting. Okay. Apologies to >> to our audience. You got two product people in here just [laughter] >> I have a lot of thoughts about where SAS is going. >> Let's get back to the workflow. So you're making your PRDS in cursor. You use the MCP and it would be just really helpful for people you know who haven't used an MCP before just to show how simple it is to >> do something like this. So let's say you wanted to push this PRD into notion or into Confluence. >> Can you show us how that how that works for people who's never seen it before? >> Right. So this this BRD looks great. Actually this I need to tell >> Look at that exclamation mark. You're so polite. >> So let's publish um it into Confluence. Uh and I already pushed it. So I'm going to tell it into >> Yeah. >> Don't overwrite the other one. We already pushed make a copy, please. And um I'm demoing this capability. All right. So we are demonstrating this capability. So this is basically all it's easy. So you always always want to look to see that your MCP server is green. It's planning it's planning its moves out. And then basically it just this is it. Like it's just running. Um it knows all of its tools. One thing, if you haven't seen how MCPS are set up, if you click on tools enabled, you can you can mouse over each one of these and you can get an understanding for how each of these tools works or what they do. Um, and for me, just when I show people the MCP descriptions here, you start to form a mental model on what tools you've given your AI. Yeah. >> And what it could do to >> and and how to ask for it. And so the other thing is not only how to ask for things from your MCP. So really understanding the naming of the tools, but the other thing is to look across your tools. And I'll tell you all a little painful >> um [clears throat] issue that I ran into is >> a lot of SAS projects or SAS products have things called projects or files or docs. And when I say update the project, it's like do you want me to update the Confluence space? Do you want me to update the chat PRD project? And so I think this ability to toggle on and off tools in the context of what you're working helps it just narrow in on what task you want to do. So a little lesson learned from Claire and um named poorly named maybe not inspecifically named MCPs. >> Exactly. The current MCP server seems to be having issues. [laughter] >> This is what we get for doing it live. Yeah. Well, and and here's here's the thing that you all, you know, here's the learning how AI. >> A couple things. I think MCPS are really opaque to people who have not set up their first one. To set one up, you're usually given, at least on a hosted MCP, a URL. You paste a couple lines of config into cursor or whatever your client is. It'll like boop you to log in to the app just like you would sort of oth another app or put in an API token. And then that should give you access to it. And then you do exactly what we're watching Dennis do right now. Um, if you all want to know the state of this highly stable technology and platform, which is you toggle this button on and off over and over again till it turns green. >> So, we're going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say what what really is going to happen is it's going to call these tools. One of these tools is going to say push a Confluence document to a space and then that's going to show up in your confluence space as you proven it has. >> This is the thread of conversation. This is what it should look like. You say publish this PRD into Confluence >> and it effectively writes it, right? So when the MCP works properly um and then in my PRD itself, I actually have a place where it can put its own published URL, right? >> Yep. >> Um so this is what it should should look like uh once you've published it. It really is this easy once the the underlying plumbing is working properly. Um, >> yeah, I do think that's worth calling out, which is it's not just one way with these MCPs. So, you again showed, hey, I can take this content that I have in cursor, I can push it to Confluence, but then you can actually do that round trip of context back into what you're working on in cursor and say, great, add the URL to that >> uh page in in my doc and update everything. And so, it's just a very nice new user interface. This used to have to be buttons and complex API mappings and now you have this you know language model that can figure out all these parameters for you based on very high level context do the work for you kind of self-heal on issues and go back and interface with other tools as well. So I think it's a really nice flow. So other than kind of creating PRDs and pushing them into notion and or confluence and how how product managery of you that they have to go both places [laughter] >> both great tools. Yeah. >> Um you what else are you doing with with these MCPs in terms of like project management, project workflow collaboration? >> You know we love to share our PRs across um the company to see what comments. Uh this is the thread where I'm now gathering like I said looks looks like people have been commenting on the PRD please go through the comment one by one and let's see how we'll respond. So what what the MCP actually does is it reads the PR it sees the exact comments. So I mean I I could use my own eyes and read the comments myself and respond to them here in Confluence but that's no fun. Um so we'll have cursor read the comments and then it actually does a breakdown. This is this I found quite hilarious. Um it it organized the comments into high priority, medium priority, and then um other different types of clarifications and then actually wrote suggested responses. Um a lot of which sounded decent. So I started saying like, \"Yep, that one's okay. Um you can respond to that one.\" And since the MCP is authenticated as Dennis as me, it appears to my other product managers at Chime that I [laughter] am responding um >> to to their comments to their comments. Yeah. >> Okay. So this is this is true behind the veil behind the veil stuff. I have not seen this before and this is spoken from somebody who has thought a lot about AI generated PRDS. So just to clarify for people who are not watching, Dennis Dennis writes his PRDS in AI. He pushes them into notion or to confluence with AI. Yes. >> He then waits a little bit, reads the comments with AI. AI generates comments back >> and you review them and you either approve or not and then they get posted >> as you. >> Right. So here's >> I love this. [laughter] I love it. Yes, that's exactly the flow. Um, and I am I'm in the loop, right? Like one of the key things about building with AI is that you want to insert the human at the appropriate point um where they make a lot they're they're adding the most value, right? So, gathering the comments, that's not value ad, but reading them and understanding them and responding like I can provide perspective there. Um, >> yeah, this is this is really interesting because I do feel like um people are really good at that push part of creating an asset and pushing it into another system, but I haven't seen somebody sort of close the loop on the next step and and iterate forward. I also think this shows that you know you you're a busy person and honestly people's you know the the comments need you to think about them and agree with a response or not but you don't have to type with your human fingers every single response and you can also prioritize what you want to focus on and I think that's really really valuable as well. Um, exactly. I mean, ruthless prioritization is what >> good product management is all about. Right. >> I love it. This episode is brought to you by Brex. [music] If you're listening to this show, you already know AI is changing how we work in real practical ways. [music] Brex is bringing that same power to finance. B is the intelligent finance platform [music] built for founders. With autonomous agents running in the background, your finance stack basically runs itself. Cards are issued, expenses are [music] filed, and fraud is stopped in real time without you having to think about it. Add Brex's banking solution with a high yield treasury account, and you've got a system that helps you [music] spend smarter, move faster, and scale with confidence. One in three startups in [music] the US already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com/howi aai. >> All right. So, what's next? After you're gathering comments, your PR is great, you're all of all of your compatriots are loving the PR that you've created and commented on. Um, typically the next step in a workflow is to ticket this out into Jira, right? So, >> uh, read the PRD and create an epic in the TIA project. >> Mhm. So I created a a task automation is our JR project that we're going to be using. Going to make sure this is green and we'll watch it work now again. So what I really like about this is that when I'm doing this right, it's reading the PRDS. I don't know what all of my other fellow product managers are like, but when Dennis creates tickets in Jira, there's I could probably do a better job. [laughter] But when Dennis's cursor creates the tickets, cursor Dennis's cursor reads the PRD that I've spent a lot of time doing and then splits the effective tickets. The story tickets in particular are very very well described. >> Yeah. >> So I I love doing this style of ticket creation because it really it does what you wish you could do if you had infinite amounts of time. It's your words, it's your PRD, it's your stories, and it's putting them where they should they should go, which is in the actual story tickets that then go to the engineers. Um, and then they can, you know, you can always just say read the PRD, but they have to read the whole PRD. >> So, let's create story tickets. Let's get this ready and when it's ready that are all, let's create story tickets that are all associated with the parent epic for this feature. And again, this this is sort of a conversational flow. Um, I've I've in my in my personal cursor for product management uh cursor rules, I'll say things like remember to always associate story tickets with their parent epic. Yep. >> Um, I did notice that >> when I was doing this at first and I didn't say associated, then it would just create orphaned tickets. [laughter] >> Yep. >> Without association. >> So, this is the flow, right? It's it's handling a lot of the busy work, right, of that I don't get a lot of value from doing. >> Well, and I want to go back to what you were saying, which is this is this is one of those tasks I say that is such a toil reducer for product managers where you really hit cognitive fatigue on translating the same content for different audiences. And like PMs out there, we feel you. We know what you do. You take your customer notes and you turn them into a PRD and then your engineers don't want to read the PRD so you make a one pager and then the one pager has to turn into an email for your boss and the email for your boss needs to be three bullet points for your CEO and like you just do all this translation and then you get to like Jira tickets or support documentation and you're like I can no longer do a good job here. I have reached the limit of my cognitive interest in this task. And so you get lazy and you like kind of like do the the epic name and the ticket names and then you say link to PRD in the in the description and you push that cognitive load on another person in your team. And so I think one of these tasks that are kind of like administrative low um you know low incremental value is a really good thing to offload something to ch you know to to claude or AI with >> completely um a lot of this like housekeeping rig roll like >> these tools are so good at um >> and then what's as you're saying this Like what's another thing that product managers constantly do which is that same exact shape? We update status. Um so how might I use cursor to update status? So here's here's here's our epic. Um let's pretend I'm one of the engineers and I pick up one of these tickets. I comment and look at the and look at the ticket has >> I know it's there >> story. It has girkin. It has acceptance criteria. man. Like >> I built an agent or two that does this in a couple other platforms than than Jura and it's just like everybody's like h I got a good ticket. I got definition of done. It's organized. So this is a better job than I would do. I'll tell you that. >> I mean this is cursor is a much better product manager than I ever was. So >> and now we're going to make it done. Right. So we're going to do some a few tickets in here. Uh again once again what is a status report other than using a tool? >> Yeah. and doing a job. So, let's once again it's time for statists reporting. Let's write a statist report and [snorts] describe everything that has happened since 94 or for this epic. Give it this epic here. >> [snorts] >> And what it'll do is it will look at it'll write JQL and essentially write a status report, right? And I've been doing this for about almost two months now where every week my weekly status report I have I have a very long cursor rule now um that I'm able to do this sort of repeatedly. Um because one thing that you'll notice is since I didn't give it what a status report was, it's going to just figure it out. This is like a a zero zero context uh status report request. Uh and you likely have some ideas as to what you want from your status report. Um so the recommendation here is you do it interactively first and then at the end this end of this whole process you would review the work and then give it feedback to do it better and then you would save that into a cursor rule of this is my weekly status report right and what we learned when we started doing this on a weekly basis is that since the source of truth was in Jira like my engineers started commenting more in Jira about what was happening because they knew that someone was looking at >> [laughter] >> Right. Um and and those words and and that context was being added to the tickets. And even if you don't even if you have a geo ticket that simply goes from in progress to done and only has a ticket title and nothing in description, that's actually sufficient context to say that this thing went from this to done, right? Um so it's really improving like communication. It's I'm I'm reducing I'm reducing the time I'm spending writing status and at the same time improving the status content that is being circulated both up to leadership and you know across the organization. >> Well, and I've been I've been to to your office so I know you all have lovely and lots of nice time together. But I also want to call out for anybody who's working in the hybrid or remote environment, one of the biggest taxes on organizations is synchronous communication where like a PM is pinging an EM or an engineer being like, what's the update here? And um and sort of like allowing those updates to go into a source of truth and then be queried in a really natural language way. Again, you don't have to change your behavior as a PM. You can still ask, \"What's the update here? what's the status your life is better but the source of that data is more structured can be more asynchronous I think allows people to like do less context switching less synchronous you know communication all those things that just give us more time to create so I think that's a really interesting secondary effect of of what you're showing here >> definitely and you know even if you're doing an inerson or over Zoom kind of status update again we have all these tools you know to record transcribe document and put all of this content back into where it should go, like hang it off of the geo ticket and then it's all organized um >> well >> for AI. Yeah. >> And now you've given me like maybe this is like a chaotic good idea, but I was like oh you know as a PM you really got to get people to like you like this is it's one of these things pro tip PM's got to be likable. And I'm like, \"Oh man, you could use the cursor or the not the cursor MCP, the Atlassian MCP to like put nice comments on Jira tickets that are done, >> right?\" Like, \"Thank you.\" I mean, thank you. >> They do a lot of they do a lot of thank you emojis. Um, >> yeah, >> right. It's the fabric of culture that we have to establish across >> Yeah. It's the fabric of culture and also just powered by a commercial large language model. >> Yeah. >> This is where this is where we're at. I I love this. I think this is a really interesting example because again it doesn't matter what the content of what you're working on >> is I think everybody can take away I can write an asset I can push it to the right sources I can query the comments I can query the feedback I can translate that for my team in whatever format they need >> and I can get aggregate insights and updates this awesome awesome flow has given me a lot of ideas that I'm going to take so we have one more quick kind of like a little bit more personal workflow that you were going to show us so Let's bop over to that and see how you start your morning. Everything's a morning briefing with you, I guess. >> Yeah, exactly. This this is what this is how I um so how do I start my day? Um one one kind of fun thing that I like to start everyone um with when I'm talking to them about chat GBT is you go into chat GBT and all you say is write me a morning briefing based on what you know about me. and chat chat GPT has added um fantastic u memory um to to its system such that its morning briefing is actually pretty decent. Um so how I begin my morning is with with the uh with JGBT every morning it essentially compiles for me what it thinks I'm going to be interesting interested in. And I've been doing this for a long time. Uh, and every morning at around 5:00 am it automat automatically creates this morning briefing for me based on what it knows about me. Um, so you can see here we had an earthquake. Uh, this the national stories. Uh, and what I did notice is after a while it's starting to actually starting to lose the plot. Um, so I need to instead of informing it by just memory, I'm thinking now I need to give it more context um, and specifics of what I want. So this this to me is actually it's informative in understanding that even open AAI is not perfect at figuring out what memory context is relevant for a very very small you know request like morning briefing. But one of the key things that I really tell everyone in in terms of how do how do we how do we learn how to use AI? You have to use it in this way and you can kind of understand and get a gut feel for how it how it does a bad job sometimes. Um it really helps you understand um how to make better AI products. >> And is this a is this a custom GPT? Do you just literally write morning briefing? Is it just a long-standing chat? What is it? >> This is a this is a chat GPT project. Okay. >> Uh into which I've placed I've given it no help. Um I have not told it >> anything around like what it should be doing or even giving it files. Um because I'm actually trying to see how it does with only the the previous threads that we made. Yeah. >> Interesting. And then you just say morning briefing and it goes. >> Yep. It used to do a fantastic job. I would say [clears throat] about a month ago it it did a great job every morning. It it's feeling like either it's losing the plot and this project is getting too big or some sort of model changes. I'm not really sure. Yeah. But >> Oh, no. That's those are bullet points. So >> yeah, >> that's that's GPT5 right there. >> Yeah, >> but I do like how, you know, they're putting these little screenshots in, which is nice. Um, >> but this is like, no, there's no AI news anymore. Like, where where'd my AI news go? >> Maybe the takeaway for folks here is, you know, if you're trying to get into AI, I think for two reasons. One, if you're trying to get into AI for personal productivity reasons, find a daily use case. It's like really simple, consistent, adds little value in your life just because it'll add a little value in your life. I think the second order effect of that though as somebody who's thinking about AI is it's a really sort of natural repetitive way to learn about the strength, weaknesses, evolution, skill sets of these core models on which almost every product, you know, for the next couple years is going to be built. And so you can start to form your own intuition as a product person of okay, like why is memory failing here? Why is context failing here? Where do instructions really help? is my two-word prompt, which I have to call you out on that just says morning briefing. Like, is that sufficient? Um, I'm coming in and I'm typing this in every morning. I should probably test the like schedule repeated task thing. And so, again, I just think get in there and find something that every day you're going to find useful so that you're getting used to these tools and you're really understanding what their capabilities are. And then if you become somebody who's going to build these tools, you're a little bit ahead. We have more language about what makes a good user experience with AI. >> Exactly. If you're not using it every single day, you will not notice. >> Yeah. >> When things get better or worse, right? >> You know what? This is very true because I open cursor today and I don't know if this is an effect of I really did not sleep well last night. >> But cursor is like so chipper today. It's like real friendly. I think also cuz I'm like quad sonnet 4 today, which I never I I rarely use. Oh, really? >> Like such a cheery little cheery little guy. Oh, yeah. I like like a like like a grumpy like a like a GPT5 middle of the road like factual staff engineer or just like a a clinically depressed Gemini 25. [laughter] So, I'm used to those. And so, I was like, why is this model being so nice to me today? Like, this is exactly what I need. And then I was like, oh, it's sweet little quad. And unless you talk to all of these different models, you won't have a mental model of how they what their personalities are like. >> All right. So, you showed us how you can just create this and kind of like prototype this morning briefing in chat GPT, but I know you you're an AI PM. You want to build this thing and I love the way you prototype your actual AI products and agentic products in cursor. So, let's whip back to cursor and I want to I want to see how you would actually go about as a PM building that kind of product and prototyping it and testing it in cursor in a really lightweight way. >> That's a great I love this question because I always tell people you should be prototyping all of your AI product ideas inside chat GPT first, right? You should just try it. which that that effectively was my morning briefing prototype was TGBT and now I use cursor itself to continue to prototype and what I call typically a super MVP super minimal and the reason why it's super minimal is because I'm using cursor itself which is AI to prototype the AI product that I'm about to build does that make sense sort of >> yeah yeah because cursor has access to all these models So >> you don't have to set up too much to at least get the baseline sort of. >> So how do we do this? So we have our PRD that we just wrote. Here's the problem. Here's some solutions. I have it write a TDD for itself. Here's my TDD for super. I say you're going to be a super MVP. You cursor are going to help me prototype and and understand how to do this. >> And and just for folks that don't live in threeletter PM word, TDD is a technical design document. Yes. So cursor itself will write a an approach a technical design document to prototype this product that I'm trying to build using AI which is a morning briefing system. So what the super MVP instructions now are is it's going to create instructions and this is what we're looking at now for cursor to do the task that I want it to do. In this case, you can see here. Step one, load the configuration. Step two, read, we have a profiles about what news to look for. Step three, use the MCP news search tool to search for news. And then, uh, process the content, summarize it, and create a report. >> So, this is effectively what some are calling prompt engineering, but instructions for the AI to do the job. >> Yep, >> that looks all great. Now I can just say at super MVP agent instructions run today's briefing. >> Yeah. >> Go make sure my MCP is still green while this is running. Looks good. [laughter] Um and there it goes. Right. So basically it's creating this report that I just defined in our PRD allowing me to prototype it. It's making I love I love their new to-do function. Oh, me too. Love it. >> Um, if you notice here, this is it's running date. Amusingly, sometimes cursor doesn't know what date or time it is, and it will argue with you, um, about what date it is. [laughter] So, I told it, um, make sure to run like the terminal date command. >> Yep. >> Um, so you can check what date it is. And this effectively is doing the whole job right now of going to the news MCP, gathering news that I'm interested in. It's going to read the output and then generate the report. And right now this I'm using cloud for sonnet. The amazing thing about this is >> I can use these same exact instructions and have GPT or Gemini or you know any other model run it and see how each model differs. Um >> okay. So, um, this may be super nerdy, but this is blowing my mind because if I if I I am somebody who builds AI products and I am somebody who thinks like prototype in a chat GPT or some like consumer general product and then pull it in. And the the silly thing that I would do that you're opening my eyes to is I would go write code. But I would like go write TypeScript or Python or whatever and I would call in these like libraries, these SDKs and I would structure my function responses and I would like do all this work. But what you're showing as a hack is cursor actually has built-in tool calling, model switching, like aentic workflows. And so bypass all that wrote setup for yourself in this prototype phase. just provide like the natural language description of the tools and functions or MCPs and let cursor do the dirty work of calling the right models, chaining the thought, all that kind of stuff. Then when you feel like your instructions in your general structure are right, great. Somebody can write some code. But this is just like such a perfect intermediary step and such a hack for this like all-purpose platform for AI that that cursor is going to become um that I think is just really clever. So good job, Dennis. >> Thanks. Yeah, this is it's a really fun way to work because >> yeah, >> like this isn't even no code. It's like zero code. Yeah, there's no >> I guess it is no code. It's it's really no code. It's not writing any code. Like no code systems would typically write code, but this is there's no code. This is the the word the words are the code. >> Well, okay. And this is not as at as um catchy as vibe coding, but we're like we're like vibe agenting. We're like writing a pretty complex like agent setup. >> And instead of like buttons and prototypes and you know forms and flows, we're just getting kind of like an AI powered experience. And now we're seeing here your morning briefing. >> Morning news. Yeah. And this is it. And I mean basically like we're we're so close to just just shipping this thing, right? Like I can this is the content. This is today's this is today's news brief for me. >> Yeah. And this is a place where then a PM can come in with opinionated um defaults on I think this should be Claude Sonnet. I think >> you know make sure you're calling a daytime tool. Like here's the MCP that I set up for myself to pull news like if not this one another one. And so it allows you to go that next step on implementation as opposed to off offloading that to the engineering team. >> Yep. >> Who might not be as opinionated on the user experience side. >> That's right. >> Love it. Very good. Bravo, my friend. Okay, Dennis, this is so fun. I have so many ideas. Um AI all the way all the way down. I I have a couple lightning round questions for you and then we'll get you out of here. >> Okay. one, do your colleagues know that you're replying to their comments with AI [laughter] or is this the spo spoiler alert? >> No, I I don't >> fellow fellow PMS. >> 100% I think they all know. I think um the one the one single benefit of us being returned to office in person is that before that I don't think people believed that I was actually a real human. So um they all know uh you know that I'm I'm fully AI enabled. Perfect. I love it. >> Um, okay. My my second use case is or my second question for you is >> how how would you recommend a PM um get started with cursor? Are you just like literally opening up a cursor and saying, \"Hey, this is going to be a a directory for product documents um and artifacts. There's going to be no code here. Set it up.\" Like what's your zero to one quick quick start? Yeah, my my 01 quick start is basically you open it up and you make a a brand new directory just called >> like blank or in my case >> and then you just start talking to it because soon as soon as you do that you'll have a chat pane, right? So uh and then you can start learning um how this actually works. >> Amazing. Okay. And then my last question, my favorite one um you were so polite you were so polite to your to your AI. Okay. So, I know this will be a good answer, but when, for example, you're toggling on and off this MCP or it's calling the wrong tool or it's overwriting your um epic tasks with the wrong thing, what is your prompting technique? What's your go-to? >> I think most people that know me know me to be a very kind, nice person. I I don't I'm not a yeller at I don't yell at the AI. Um, I say a lot of please. I say, as you noticed, I'd use a lot of exclamation points. Um, and sometimes I just kind of start the thread all over and just like, all right, let's just start new. Right. Completely uh time travel back in time and be like, let's let's start over. Maybe you need a break. >> Oh, that response has just like soothed my inner child. So, I love to hear it. Very calm, very positive, very kind, and just walk away when you need to. That's a wise response. Okay, Dennis, this has been so great. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? Um, you can find me I'm online typically as send uh Dennis backwards on Twitter X uh and then LinkedIn. You can find me there. I'm just Dennis Dennis Yang. Uh and I'll be speaking at the Fintech NerdCon conference in November. Um trying to gather as many AI enabled people there. So come and come and join me there. >> Amazing.

    "description": "In this episode, I share my hands-on experience with OpenAI’s GPT-5, the company’s new frontier model. As one of the first users outside of OpenAI to test the model, I put GPT-5 head-to-head with GPT-4.1 across real-world product use cases—from writing PRDs to generating code to assisting with visual design work. This is my unfiltered look at what GPT-5 can (and can’t) do—and how it changes the game for builders.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. How GPT-5 differs from previous models with its engineering-focused approach to problem-solving and tendency to prioritize technical details over business context\n2. A comparative analysis of how GPT-5 and GPT-4.1 generate different types of product requirement documents and prototypes for the same prompt\n3. Why GPT-5 excels at technical writing, functional requirements, and code generation while potentially skipping important business discovery questions\n4.

We then spin up an MCP that lets Goose talk to Square’s dashboard for inventory management, vibe code an email MCP that can send payment links automatically, and unpack how environment setup, debugging, and tool orchestration get handled behind the scenes.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n1. A practical, repeatable workflow for turning any working script or function into a custom MCP—and exposing it to natural-language control\n2. How to transform messy CSVs into visualizations, HTML reports, and actionable business insights without needing a data science background\n3. Ways to hook Goose into live business systems (e.g. Square inventory, payments) so analysis flows directly into operational action\n4. The thinking behind Block’s decision to open-source Goose\n5. Lessons from Block’s bottom-up meets top-down adoption model\n6. Why organizational transformation, not just picking the right LLM, will separate AI winners from laggards over the next few years\n7. How to scale an internal MCP catalog\n8. The organizational transformation required to fully leverage AI capabilities\n\n*Brought to you by:*\nCodeRabbit—Cut code review time and bugs in half.

    "description": "John Blackman, a 91-year-old retired electrical engineer, shares how he used Claude and Replit to build a complex application for his church's community service events—with no prior software development experience and for less than $350. His app allows event organizers to create events, recruit volunteers, and manage sign-ups, with a standout feature for organizing free oil changes for participants.\n\n*What you'll learn:*\n1. How John used Claude to create detailed product requirements and user stories\n2. John's philosophy on embracing new technology throughout his career\n3. The exact process for integrating third-party APIs (like VIN lookup for oil changes) with minimal technical knowledge\n4. How he automated report generation for volunteer management and resource planning\n5. How the software generates personalized \"Impact Passports\" for event participants\n6. Why letting AI build without preconceived notions of \"correct\" implementation can lead to faster, more functional results\n7.

    "description": "Sahil Lavingia is the CEO and founder of Gumroad, where AI agents are already writing 41% of all code commits, and they’re targeting 80% by year-end. Sahil demonstrates how this approach allows him to transform what would typically be two-week projects into two-hour implementations—a 40x productivity increase.\n\nWhat you'll learn:\n1. The exact AI workflow Sahil uses to build features 40x faster—from prototyping in v0 to implementation with Devin\n2. How Gumroad incentivizes AI adoption across the organization with $33,000 bounties for engineers who outperform the CEO\n3. How to use component libraries like shadcn/ui for effective AI development\n4. How AI is shifting engineering roles toward architecture and tech debt removal while enabling designers and PMs to ship features directly\n5.
